1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,519
 

2
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,959
Now the spectrum of the ball flash has been precisely matched with the human body

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,559
This is a masterpiece just for you

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,559
The signal near the high-altitude station disappeared instantly

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,159
above

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,919
It's like suddenly adding a transparent cover

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,839
Ball lightning breaks down the boundary between macro and micro

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,199
quantum body

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,239
like a mold

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,159
Infected our macrocosm

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,719
once it starts expanding

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,159
The whole space generates what we don't understand

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,879
Uncontrollable mutations

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,879
i pressed

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,199
Listen to you

16
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,039
alarm

17
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,439
Ball lightning recovery program interrupted

18
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,879
Please fix it now

19
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,199
alarm

20
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,599
Ball lightning recovery program interrupted

21
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,999
Please fix it now

22
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,559
be the first to break

23
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,879
you are admirable

24
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,199
von neumann

25
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,759
host

26
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,399
will be with you forever

27
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,959
He faced only one

28
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,759
poor strategist

29
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,239
An Unqualified Wallfacer

30
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,159
you are jealous of him

31
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,159
Rey Diaz's hibernation application

32
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,359
have passed

33
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,199
same with hines

34
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,559
It seems that in a normal life

35
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,399
we can complete the mission

36
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,079
but you don't want to know

37
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,079
Ladder

38
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,879
what the hell is going on now

39
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,879
taylor is broken

40
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,239
But Luo Ji is still on it

41
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,919
I only know

42
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,359
what the lord needs me to know

43
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,399
do not forget

44
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,119
Luo Ji confronted the Lord directly

45
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,599
and

46
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,279
Regardless of ETO

47
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,039
or ordinary human

48
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,679
Lord's Blockade of Microcosms

49
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,799
all thorough

50
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,199
just
checked

51
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,039
The door that leads directly out of the cabin is broken

52
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,159
This window is aerospace glass again

53
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,599
None of the high-speed fragments penetrated

54
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,039
we can't break it

55
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,439
And even if you go out

56
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,119
How to return to the ground is also a problem

57
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,799
Fortunately, there are still supplies left

58
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,759
You feel

59
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,279
Does the PDC know we're alive?

60
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,799
Hard to say

61
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,399
i always wanted to ask

62
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,079
Do you really have what it takes to defeat aliens?

63
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,479
All right

64
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,879
look here

65
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,839
I just snap my fingers

66
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,439
solar system

67
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,839
will disappear

68
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,919
really believe

69
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,519
lied to you

70
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,479
there is no superman in this world

71
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,039
Wallfacer

72
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,359
Isn't it?

73
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,679
If only it would be great

74
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,759
do you think i look like superman now

75
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,039
What's going on? Why hasn't Chairman Say arrived yet?

76
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,799
Ladders are the heart of humanity's near-earth defenses

77
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,759
what's going on now

78
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,799
I heard only one hatch was damaged

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,759
don't know

80
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,399
The flight control center does not release the message

81
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,759
It must be related to the broken wall

82
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,839
What about the rescue plan?

83
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
why doesn't she vote for us

84
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,279
I heard that Luo Ji, the Wallfacer, is on it

85
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,079
real

86
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,279
that's troublesome

87
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,159
Contact Ronan

88
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,919
ask the chairman how long

89
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,719
Need not

90
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,559
I am attending the meeting on behalf of President Say

91
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,159
no one can replace her

92
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,959
yes

93
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,559
So the chairman must fully direct the rescue.

94
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,399
Other things

95
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,799
she authorized me

96
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,319
The only way is to give up the ladder

97
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,159
Why

98
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,919
Pictures from the low-altitude station show

99
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,919
The high-altitude station now has two symmetrical quantum bodies

100
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,239
It should be what Dr. Ding said

101
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,679
centered on the macronucleus

102
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,239
The resulting symmetrical energy range

103
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,599
But human understanding of the microcosm is too limited

104
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,159
The only possibility is

105
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,999
can keep it away from us

106
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,919
you see

107
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,119
The counterweight station at the top is also a nuclear power plant

108
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,559
Just turn on the maximum magnetic force

109
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,199
quantum body will be attracted

110
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,199
Floating into the deep space with the Yellow River Station

111
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,399
Be attracted

112
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,399
you sure

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,919
right

114
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,319
dare not say anything else

115
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,159
but i found

116
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,879
Even if the ball flash becomes a quantum body

117
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,079
The properties of macroelectronics are still preserved

118
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,639
So these primitive properties

119
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,239
can be used by us

120
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,959
for example

121
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,079
magnetic confinement

122
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,119
you verified

123
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,199
In theory, right?

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,279
I'm in Dr. Elena's last message

125
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,279
Energy level data for ball flashes found

126
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,319
After inputting the inferred quantum body model

127
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,359
It went through

128
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,439
what does this mean

129
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,239
dna

130
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,839
like human dna

131
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,439
some things never change

132
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,519
Ball lightning can be confined by magnetic fields

133
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,519
Quantum bodies should also be able to

134
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,839
which means

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,798
Activated the nuclear power plant at the top of the ladder

136
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,119
is equivalent to creating a predictable

137
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,918
The movement route of the quantum body

138
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,799
In the end, the Yellow River Station will be divided into two

139
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,639
out of part

140
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,999
will be taken to deep space with the quantum body

141
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,639
And the macrograviton fluctuations are not continuous

142
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,079
Once the gravitational pull on people weakens

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,239
Survivors have a high probability of waiting until our rescue

144
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,239
Can the power of the sub-nuclear power plant work?

145
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,679
Risk assessment form data is not very good

146
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,319
almost

147
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,839
All departments are doing their best

148
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,559
Verification data has been submitted

149
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,759
this is the only way now

150
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,799
But our fiber optics up there won't work

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,559
All wireless signals are lost

152
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,679
The only console that can issue commands to the Yellow River Station

153
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,159
Only the sky station is left

154
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,439
Our spaceship can't get in again

155
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,719
Survivors can't be contacted again

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,999
not waiting to die

157
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,239
this thing

158
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,639
evil enough

159
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,239
come out evil

160
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,319
don't keep it

161
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,959
Say it

162
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,199
looking for someone

163
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,079
I have a way

164
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,039
Dr. Ding

165
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,359
we can see above

166
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,159
Then it must not cover the light

167
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,479
strictly speaking

168
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,599
in all electromagnetic waves

169
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,439
Only part of visible light can pass through

170
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,079
buzz

171
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,959
Do you have something that can shine?

172
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,559
The kind that shines far away

173
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,839
Is it reflective?

174
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,599
Solar panels

175
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,359
that became

176
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,079
chairman

177
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,479
Have you heard of the Beacon Tower?

178
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,599
Yes Dashi

179
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,759
A way to communicate with the quantum body

180
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,319
I'm really blinded by you

181
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,439
16th pass

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,959
The azimuth is adjusted forward by 27 arc seconds

Focusing on sunlight

193
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,799
What is the transmission distance

00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,959
Make sure you can see the ring road C

197
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,959
I guess it's just those few places where people are breathing.

198
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,599
no problem

199
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,519
Even with slight scattering in the light path

200
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,799
The light intensity is also sufficient

201
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,919
just don't know survivor

202
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,239
How many people can understand Morse code?

203
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,519
i sometimes

204
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,839
also thinking

205
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,919
Been a Wallfacer for so long

206
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,679
you

207
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,519
It must be difficult

208
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,199
yes

209
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,719
but i want to make it easier

210
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,159
That's it

211
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,039
When Michelangelo painted Genesis

212
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,079
There is a small worker to help him pass the brush

213
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,639
pass it over

214
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,239
more than four years

215
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,799
But he says it's the most rewarding job

216
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,559
Because he could never paint Genesis himself

217
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,439
If you can give a little effort to the painter

218
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,519
It seems that I have value

219
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,159
This is how I feel when I meet you

220
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,639
you compare me to michelangelo

221
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,279
do you know how good he is

222
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,439
I know

223
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,759
I studied art history

224
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,119
i shouldn't have brought you up

225
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,919
if not stuck here

226
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,719
I didn't even know the earth was so beautiful

227
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,519
if this is the last view

228
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,559
not bad

229
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,559
Is it right

230
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,319
Luo Ji

231
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,639
quick

232
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,559
do you have pen and paper

233
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,359
give it to me

234
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,639
 

235
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,159
Oh my god

236
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,679
This is

237
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,759
What

238
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,239
chairman

239
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,039
Do you want to change another way

240
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,599
give them time

241
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,039
hold on

242
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,119
short length is

243
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,159
Emergency energy supply system activated

244
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,359
Temporary restoration of the high-altitude ring lighting subsystem

245
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,919
take a look

246
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,119
is there light

247
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,519
pass down pass down

248
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,239
hurry up

249
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,759
The picture is here

250
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,319
There is a light source at the location of the high-altitude station

251
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,719
Very good

252
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,079
I got it right

253
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,959
is morse code

254
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,999
we are saved

255
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,279
someone is looking for us

256
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,319
we're fine

257
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,679
great great

258
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,439
what's wrong with ding yi

259
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,839
I'm afraid there's no time to celebrate

260
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,999
Not to spoil everyone's happiness

261
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,799
Data show quantum body expansion then speeds up

262
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,559
The distance ladder is fully covered

263
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,599
about

264
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,759
8 hours

265
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,399
you mean

266
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,839
All Ladder Survivors

267
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,359
Including the people in the low-altitude station now

268
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,679
will all die

269
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,279
right

270
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,559
chairman

271
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,879
The survivor area is about to enter the light range

272
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,879
Quick Shiqiang

273
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,439
Communicating Key Content to Survivors

274
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,159
clear

275
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,319
Don't you all want to know the complete rescue plan?

276
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,119
Survivors should be in emergency shelter C1

277
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,039
so that the backup power can be activated

278
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,399
But it's too close to the quantum body

279
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,239
They have to go through the outer ring compartment

280
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,039
move to

281
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,679
Gravity Port 2

282
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,319
back to center axis

283
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,679
when we came up

284
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,599
But Gravity Port 2 has been blown up.

285
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,039
I'm afraid I'll have to go outside for a while.

286
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,359
The sides are sealed off

287
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
Subsequent operations require a lot of energy

288
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,279
So you have to find the N48 supply station along the central axis

289
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,719
also a safe spot

290
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,199
Because the quantum body moves up

291
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,719
Make sure not to move here

292
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,599
and this location

293
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,479
minimal damage

294
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,239
But it's too dangerous outside

295
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,119
The compartment is broken like this

296
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,879
It's not as safe as in a suit

297
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,039
and I calculated

298
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,719
Once the quantum body starts moving up

299
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,479
The N48 supply depot will be a perfectly safe location

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,479
when they are done

301
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,719
gotta get back to this position

302
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,359
to wait for our rescue

303
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,199
Precautions?

304
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,479
The extravehicular suit is fully intelligent

305
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,959
Everything can be operated according to the UI

306
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,199
only one

307
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,679
Do not enable visual enhancement mode

308
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,639
WTF

309
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,439
Do you understand

310
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,719
I am a secondary engineer

311
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,599
what do you say

312
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,519
Features developed when the ladder was built

313
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,399
Can reconstruct surrounding environment data

314
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,679
but untrained ordinary people

315
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,559
On the contrary, it will affect their normal vision

316
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,559
In short

317
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,279
do one's best

318
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,559
listen to fate

319
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,599
They say this quantum state stuff

320
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,079
Will cover here soon

321
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,279
what should we do

322
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,679
Engineer Yang

323
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,799
Since he can understand

324
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,159
Probably in Morse code too

325
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,799
Let him reveal his identity with a flash

326
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,559
in case of accident

327
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,919
in the last hours

328
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,719
All human beings will remember his sacrifice

329
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,519
chairman

330
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,479
How about it

331
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,319
what did he say

332
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,559
Luo Ji

333
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,439
Wallfacer

334
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,119
turned out to be him

335
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,159
can't be such a coincidence

336
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,199
I'm sure now

337
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,879
great chairman

338
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,039
stop action

339
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,239
Warning that the ladder gravity system is about to be paralyzed

340
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,759
What's wrong

341
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,439
have no idea

342
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
Maybe there's something wrong with the center shaft.

343
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,439
your notes

344
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,079
leave it alone

345
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,079
direction is changing

346
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,879
hold on to me first

347
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,039
good

348
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,519
careful

349
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,279
why we stand on the wall

350
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,919
something else floats

351
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,359
Is it a gravity glitch?

352
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,879
No

353
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,479
I'm afraid the quantum body is getting close.

354
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,519
quick

355
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,759
go to the console

356
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,559
We need to contact the PDC

357
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,879
chairman

358
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,639
there is no other way

359
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,199
I think

360
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,359
The chairman is following the wallface act

361
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,559
But which of the bills

362
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,679
Allow us to let the Wallfacers go on adventures?

363
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,159
before he was assisted

364
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,639
You should wait for the rescue of the PDC at a safe point.

365
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,919
chairman

366
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,839
Even if we can find one more survivor

367
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,759
time is too late

368
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,279
Only nuclear power plants are activated

369
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,159
Only when you are safe can you be safe

370
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,359
so without him

371
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,759
rescue plan impossible

372
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,159
but put the Wallfacer's life at risk

373
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,799
It's the PDC's dereliction of duty

374
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,519
we can't take this responsibility

375
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,879
chairman

376
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,159
it's all on

377
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,999
Do you want to let the spaceship enter again?

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,919
Engineer Yang

379
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,079
Ding Yi

380
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,519
I go out for a few minutes

381
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,959
you can't

382
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,159
Chairman of the PDC

383
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,119
Don't put Wallfacer in danger

384
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,279
But you can set up Luo Ji's temporary staff

385
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,799
any consequences

386
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,159
i say bear

387
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,559
clear

388
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,759
quick

389
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,359
Is there anything else you haven't told Wallfacer?

390
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,159
to upload

391
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,799
Ding Yi

392
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,879
we live here

393
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,679
hurry up

394
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,319
good

395
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,279
Now the situation is more complicated than before

396
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,319
Quantum body has expanded to a certain extent

397
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,439
The resulting gravitational disturbance is also increasing

398
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,719
It stands to reason that they are inside the quantum body

399
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,079
Using the observer effect to escape is the most reliable

400
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,879
But now Luo Ji can't get out of the shield

401
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,279
Establish a stable exchange of information

402
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,759
His only means of escape now is the extravehicular suit

403
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,919
but only on this

404
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,919
Under normal circumstances, it is impossible to break free from the range of gravity

405
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,919
What about the general situation?

406
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,719
speak English

407
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,879
It's like crashing into a high-speed carousel

408
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,799
Wallfacers have to jump into the gravitational net first

409
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,359
in an elastic collision

410
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,599
exchange angular momentum with it

411
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,439
I see

412
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,879
think of it as a gravity booster

413
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,479
Gain acceleration while turning

414
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,159
yes

415
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,239
Similar to gravitational slingshot effect

416
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,199
Do you have to go in the direction of the quantum body?

417
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,719
why don't we go straight out along the hatchway

418
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,319
It is impossible to break free from gravity directly

419
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,959
Only by being thrown out by force

420
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,159
no

421
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,479
Quantum is too dangerous

422
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,559
It's too late for people to run

423
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,839
How can you jump in?

424
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,639
this is no way

425
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,239
The probability density outside the conscious level is relatively low

426
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,839
As long as Luo Ji passes through there

427
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,599
And fast enough

428
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,239
can avoid the influence of the quantum body to the greatest extent

429
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,359
Jet vector angle 31 degrees

430
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,079
Jet flow 400 per second

431
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,119
Take off according to the parameters I calculated

432
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,319
Thruster parameter setting completed

433
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,399
Do you wear it now?

434
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,719
Tell them to talk through the helmet

435
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,479
Luo Ji called Miss Yan

436
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,159
OVER (end)

437
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,439
Miss Yan received

438
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,319
OVER (end)

439
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,679
By the time

440
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,919
There will be electromagnetic interference

441
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,079
If you get too close to the quantum body

442
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,439
This is the effect

443
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,479
murmur


444
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,119
Don't you know that thing is near?

445
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,679
Works better than any alarm

446
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,159
There are many evil tricks

447
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,399
The depressurization of the cabin is about to be completed

448
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,719
Please confirm that preparations are complete

449
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,439
Have the conditions to leave the cabin

450
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,799
Before departure

451
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,319
Be sure to use the emergency console

452
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,799
Open all hatch main doors

453
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,599
Only in this way

454
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,399
to make room for them as much as possible.

455
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,959
space to fly safely

456
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,199
tell him

457
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,519
No matter what sights that subvert common sense

458
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,599
Another I panic

459
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,519
leave quickly

460
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,439
you're not as cynical as they say

461
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,279
and on the contrary

462
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,319
how many people have you met

463
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,399
real

464
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,559
Uncle Shi also said the same

465
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,639
before

466
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,439
It's because I don't worry about anything

467
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,239
not give a damn about

468
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,039
what about now

469
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,439
because

470
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,959
care too much

471
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,679
us

472
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,879
we succeeded

473
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,999
almost

474
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,199
should be soon

475
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,879
catch me

476
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,679
quick

477
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,799
Spatial positioning anomaly detected

478
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,279
The system judges the cross-cabin EVA operation

479
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,799
Enhanced visual mode is automatically enabled

480
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,959
got you

481
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,519
wait for me

482
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,759
Attitude stabilization mode enabled

483
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,839
How are you, Luo Ji?

484
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,119
wake up

485
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,879
The overweight overload value is reduced to a safe range

486
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,919
Luo Ji wake up

487
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,079
Enhanced visual mode disabled

488
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,679
look

489
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,719
they are still alive

490
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,479
Luo Ji

491
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,919
The quantum body seems to be approaching

492
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,839
you have to come back quickly

493
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,479
I can't ignore

494
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,959
Otherwise we will both die here

495
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,919
Did you hear that
