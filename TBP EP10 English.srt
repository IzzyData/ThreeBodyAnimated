1
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,799
After 400 years, the three-body civilization will arrive.

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,119
Before then

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,559
live happily.

4
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,159
Live on your own terms.

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,479
This is a responsibility you have to yourself.

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,839
These two big living people can't stand it.

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,879
Nothing can happen to him or Zhuang Yan.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,479
Thank you Mr. Luo Ji.

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,159
I will remember the starry sky tonight.

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,319
Von Neumann

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,679
Frederick Tyler's Wall Breaker.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,238
The B436 project experiment has come a long way.

13
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,119
I advise you

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,439
Enough is enough.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,919
We just want to observe the energy redundancy after the ball lightning attack.

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,319
It's completely safe.

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,079
Who's in charge here?

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,599
Mr. Tyler.

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,199
I

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,319
am your wall breaker.

21
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,519
Call security.

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,959
Get him out of here.

23
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,479
Monitor the ball lightning recovery progress.

24
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,119
Remote sensors show that Ghost 1 has locked the position of the ball lightning. 

25
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,719
The ball lightning was captured successfully.

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,439
The recycling program is working fine.

27
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,079
Thank you sir.

28
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,319
I won't take long.

29
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,799
You are planning to create a

30
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,799
space army armed with ball lightning.

31
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,279
Am I right?

32
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,639
Pity

33
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,239
No one survived. 

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,839
Are you crazy?

35
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,479
How could there be people on the target ship?

36
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,719
Troubleshoot the tracks.

37
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,679
Start the return journey.

38
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,639
Acknowledged.

39
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,759
Thanks.

40
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,078
At the last experiment on the ground

41
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,759
The real target 

42
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,079
wasn't that black obelisk

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,839
despite its beauty.

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,479
However, you don't care.

45
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,999
I noticed

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,519
Your sight is always intentional and unintentional.

47
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,239
observing those sheep.

48
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,559
Certainly.

49
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,359
Yes.

50
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,719
They are everywhere.

51
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,759
But you're actually paying attention to their behavior.

52
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,919
You see that they are everywhere in the desert. 

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,799
You know nothing about them except that they eat

54
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,399
and are active near the target area.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,039
Leave them be.

56
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,599
This is an advanced laboratory.

57
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,919
Then under your ingenious arrangement

58
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,399
had them struck by ball lightning with a modified spectrum.

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,239
In the quantum state

60
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,159
they could pass through walls.

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,519
Like the real accident

62
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,159
they appeared in the target area

63
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,559
So the sheep

64
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,119
Or

65
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,519
the quantum sheep being attracted by the residual magnetic field

66
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,679
is your real goal.

67
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,519
And that expensive black brick

68
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,639
And your anger at Dr. Elena.

69
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,679
you only hold me back.

70
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,919
It's just an act for your scheme.

71
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,119
Your have a rich imagination

72
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,039
but, my enemy is your lord,

73
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,319
not a sheep.

74
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,199
Of course.

75
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,119
So you visited Dr. Ding Yi again.

76
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,679
Elena is too young

77
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,679
and lacks experience in space operations.

78
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,159
I still hope

79
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,519
you can lead my experiment.

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,879
But you don't care about Ding Yi's reply

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,679
What you want to inquire about

82
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,559
is the B436 experiment.

83
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,879
Secret Records on Spectrum

84
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,319
and about

85
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,279
the experiments many years ago

86
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,879
where a woman was declared dead.

87
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,239
Start recording.

88
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,519
7 o'clock sharp.

89
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,999
Instrument calibration complete.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,959
please confirm.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,999
Who is speaking?

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,479
You won't answer the idiot bogg's question.

93
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,359
It doesn't matter whos voice that is.

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,159
How she "died" matters.

95
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,559
It's almost time.

96
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,359
Allow me to summarize your thinking.

97
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,319
Firstly

98
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,719
The sheep get hit outside target area.

99
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,639
Their ear tags are miles away.

100
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,759
You are satisfied with the result.

101
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,399
You believe that as long as the spectrum modulation of the ball lightning is correct

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,199
organisms are not only in a quantum state

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,719
they are also invisible to the naked eye

104
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,519
and survive for a while

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,999
and the handwriting that appeared after the woman's death proves that.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,559
Human beings can not only be quantized

107
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,439
they are also likely to retain self-awareness.

108
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,439
Even to some extent

109
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,799
impact our macrocosm.

110
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,159
You abandoned morality to defeat the trisolarins.

111
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,799
This is not easy. 

112
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,039
I express my sincere admiration.

113
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,119
But, I should remind you

114
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,239
this

115
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,159
is murder.

116
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,639
War is a kind of murder.

117
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,919
No.

118
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,839
I mean kill your own kind.

119
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,879
I didn't kill anyone.

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,319
You will kill soon.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,879
Alert.

122
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,399
The base system is paralyzed.

123
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,799
Ball lightning recovery procedure tampered with.

124
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,479
Please troubleshoot immediately.

125
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,359
Our communication system with the outside world has also been interrupted.

126
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,599
Right..

127
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,799
Now that the spectrum of the ball lightning

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,839
has been precisely matched with the human body.

129
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,039
This spectrum..

130
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,039
What is this?

131
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,158
This is a masterpiece just for you.

132
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,999
Recycling process is automatic.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,798
Stop panicing. 

134
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,918
Restart the system.

135
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,399
Contact PDC immediately.

136
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,479
Ok Mr. Tyler.

137
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,759
Don't worry.

138
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,359
Four centuries is not long.

139
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,559
For human history

140
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,719
it's quite soon. 

141
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,199
In the morning of the doomsday war

142
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,519
you can imagine

143
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,759
Your average space soldier wakes up early

144
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,639
and hide a yellowed photo in a battle suit.

145
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,439
This is the decisive battle that

146
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,999
he has been waiting for nearly a hundred years for.

147
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,159
Additional load released.

148
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,799
time leads a path

149
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,079
Limit speed increased by 63.16%

150
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,879
that finally comes to an end.

151
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,079
The night sky is gradually lit up by battleships.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,439
Intuition tells him

153
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,679
the battle begins.

154
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,719
Control center please answer.

155
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,599
Ghost 1.

156
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,839
Moving towards the ladder

157
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,999
Please answer.

158
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,319
Call Experiment Center.

159
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,879
Ghost 1 has deviated 4 kilometers.

160
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,959
Can you hear?

161
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,439
He took off in a battleship

162
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,599
In front of you is where all the soldiers meet

163
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,999
fire and blood

164
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,999
will shine here

165
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,239
he swears by it.

166
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,039
His child is waiting for him.

167
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,079
Long hibernation caused him to miss his parents' funeral

168
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,039
He doesn't want to miss his daughter's.

169
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,759
Target acceleration too high

170
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,319
It is recommended to suspend the docking order.

171
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,359
Ignore suggestion.

172
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,239
Suddenly

173
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,879
A beam of light hits his battleship.

174
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,879
Dock fit 43%

175
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,079
Unable to complete docking.

176
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,279
The last thing he sees

177
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,719
are countless blue suns.

178
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,279
You call it

179
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,119
ball lightning.

180
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,519
Dock fit 57%

181
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,719
His last thoughts

182
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,999
Dock fit 72%

183
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,399
Did my comrades attack me?

184
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,599
Can he return to his daughter?

185
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,679
Dock fit 93%

186
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,359
Dock fit 100%

187
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,999
Docking completed

188
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,879
But these questions

189
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,439
won't get an answer.

190
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,079
And then..

191
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,599
Cabin damage.

192
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,479
Countless flesh and blood bodies instantly became human ghosts in the quantum state.

193
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,159
Please fix it ASAP.

194
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,839
Give up docking.

195
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,159
Measure the speed of the target ship.

196
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,319
Now..

197
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,839

199
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,439
invincible.

200
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
Restart to complete the restoration of some system modules.

201
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,399
Delayed data just received.

202
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,919

204
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,199
Dr. Elena.

205
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,519
She is on it. 

206
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,199
flying to the ball lightning.

207
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,879
About to enter the track where the ladder is located.

208
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,319
Send a message to the flight control center.

209
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,919
No, the communication module is still loading.

210
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,119
Progress seems to be stuck.

211
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,319
What have you done?

212
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,359
I did what you wanted.

213
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,159
Create communication window.

214
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,919
Contact Elena.

215
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,919
What's going on?

216
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,519
Possibly trying to crash the runaway ship #1 back into orbit

217
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,839
but we can't do it remotely.

218
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,519
Can't connect.

219
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,879
I can't send any commands.

220
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,799
Send someone to chase.

221
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,959
What are you talking about?

222
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,079
She seems to be

223
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,199
flying the last ship.

224
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,519
All of this

225
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,999
It's not because you don't have the cunning

226
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,279
The target ship yaws by 0.08.

227
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,079
but because

228
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,919
you are too arrogant.

229
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,319
However..

230
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,999
Lord does not care.

236
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,679
forced her to throw away.

237
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,119
Cheer up Mr. Tyler

238
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,639
Anyway, your experiments

239
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,799
don't need her anymore.

240
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,839
Or

241
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,399
you never needed her.

242
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,799

248
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,159
Wait..

249
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,839
I know I'm unreliable in your eyes

250
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,479
but,

251
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,839
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,159

I was afraid of letting you go. 

255
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,719
and I would regret it forever.

256
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,679
No

257
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,479

Nothing else.

261
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,959

Ladder track position deviation increased.

382
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,519
Find a space-based observing system.

383
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,119
I want more accurate track data.

384
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,959
Chairman.

385
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,519
The sky ladder high-altitude station was hit.

386
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,559
The situation is very serious.

387
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,119
Alright.

388
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,519
what do you want to say

389
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,719
The wallbreaker website has revealed Mr. Tyler's plans.

390
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,959
Millions of words.

391
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,399
So quickly.

392
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,439
Block the messages.

393
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,759
Go to the flight control center now.

394
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,439
Acknowledged.

395
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,879
Get in touch with Mr. Tyler's lab as soon as possible.

396
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,959
Clear.

397
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,239
The second team is about to arrive at the traffic hall.

398
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,519
Those with extravehicular tools go first.

399
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,799
Gas composition analysis. 

400
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,799
Understood.

401
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,319
Quick.

402
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,119
Send it to the professor.

403
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,239
We need to get to the flight control center immediately

404
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,119
Sign here qickly. 

405
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,039
I have to get to the next one.

406
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,639
Pay on delivery.

407
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,399
Yeah.

408
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,239
Hurry up.

409
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,119
Do you want something?

410
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,519
No thank you.

411
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,279
I'll leave it here. 

412
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,799
Automatic debit.

413
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,879
Buckle up.

414
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,919
Don’t worry.

415
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,879
The data inside

416
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,279
was fully recovered.

417
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,119
Just as I thought.

418
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,439
Your judgment is basically accurate.

419
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,999
I mean how how I think

420
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,599
you cut this

421
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,839
so cleanly.

422
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,879
I remember when I was in Daxinganling

423
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,679
It is like the trees that were cut down

424
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,359
but the fracture was much rougher.

425
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,159
Seems like flying blade is pretty powerful.

426
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,079
Your solar system defense system

427
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,839
Is it ready to be built?

428
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,959
Don't ask her how she knows.

429
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,639
Last question.

430
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,199
No more questions. 

431
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,479
Just let me remind you.

432
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,759
Humans can't control the power they have

433
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,639
in the face of madness.

434
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,879
Reasoning

435
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,999
is weak.

436
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,519
This

437
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,199
Isn't it just an example?

438
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,919
you

439
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,359
do you have any wishes?

440
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,479
Such a pity

441
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,799
My time

442
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,239
is running out.

443
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,959
Don't worry

444
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,359
Your application to return to Red Coast

445
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,759
has been approved.

446
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,519
Thank you.

447
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,799
or

448
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,399
Do you still want to visit your daughter's grave?

449
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,079
What I want to tell him

450
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,519
is that it's over.

451
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,279
Take care

452
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,119
Professor Ye.

453
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,559
I lit the fire

454
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,079
but can't control it.

455
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,919
The fire started to spread

456
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,039
I did what I could.

457
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,639
Now

458
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,159
It's your turn.

459
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,039
Although for them a few light-years away

460
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,639
It doesn't make sense.

461
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,719
But for me

462
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,759
it is meaningful.

463
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,679
We can only choose whether to sacrifice

464
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,839
but can't choose what to sacrifice.

465
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,759
Mr. Tyler

466
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,759
We support you.

467
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,439
President says..
