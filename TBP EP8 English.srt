1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,039
 

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,959
Once you surrender and before you die.

3
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,399
How would Trisolarans treat human prisoners of war?

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,719
It's hundreds of years later..

5
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,879
Who cares.

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,719
Voiceprint confirmed.

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,279
The excitation area is ready to begin. 

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,879
300 kA

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,559
I want a weapon

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,079
and you talk to me about safety.

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,519
600 kA

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,479
Let's not talk about safety, ok?

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,879
Then I excite the macroelectrons to the highest energy state

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,878
800 kA

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,359
Are the experiment results still valid?

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,399
Polluted.

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,159
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,719
An utter waste. 

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,999
You are

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,879
only holding me back.

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,159
Come in.

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,519
No need to remove your shoes.

23
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,039
Out with it. 

24
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,439
What is it?

25
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,759
Here is a structural diagram of the space station.

26
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,079
You know this area better than me.

27
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,599
Elena is too young

28
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,599
and has a lack of experience in space operations.

29
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,039
I still have hope

30
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,199
you can be the leader of this project.

31
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,039
I can't go.

32
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,159
Of course. 

33
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,279
It can wait for you to finish your vacation.

34
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,039
Don't bother. 

35
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,639
This experiment will fail.

36
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,119
Before you do your particle collision experiment

37
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,839
did you know the result?

38
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,159
So..

39
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,839
Scientists have their assertions but,

40
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,399
it's better to get proof.

41
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,879
It's wasn't easy for you to travel all the way here

42
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,239
So i'll just say it.

43
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,919
Trisolaran understanding of macroelectrons

44
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,319
is much greater than humans.

45
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,359
Using this weapon on them

46
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,479
is just playing tricks.

47
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,599
Ah, you don't know Luban.

48
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,119
Anyway, do you think

49
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,319
this experiment can succeed?

50
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,879
or have the same result. 

51
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,439
I would advise you

52
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,919
to change your mind.

53
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,759
Dr. Ding

54
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,159
you can also change your mind.

55
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,839
Since the sophon lock

56
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,999
you have nothing to study.

57
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,679
The scientific research department can't even pay your salary

58
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,879
Not to mention experimental funding.

59
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,759
You are an realistic person

60
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,119
you need to take a chance.

61
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,119
I need you for my experiment.

62
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,279
it's a win-win.

63
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,759
Dr. Ding

64
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,559
I have said what has needed to be said.

65
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,559
I hope you will think about it.

66
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,239
Otherwise

67
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,079
Sai can't help you either.

68
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,279
Have you ever drank urine?

69
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,039
What?

70
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,359
Your own urine.

71
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,479
Have you ever drank it?

72
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,439
Do you know who you're talking to?

73
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,279
What's the problem?

74
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,599
I just drank it. 

75
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,039
The kind filtered by the circulation system on the space station.

76
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,159
I drank it for more than three hundred days.

77
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,399
To confirm

78
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,279
those two invisible things.

79
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,399
This is who I am

80
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,279
you know.

81
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,799
I'm just a research nerd.

82
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,639
How much money is left..

83
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,359
How much can the project push. 

84
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,799
Do your best and listen to destiny. 

85
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,479
These days, you have to figure it out.

86
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,999
Theoretical physics

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,959
and applied physics.

88
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,879
If applied physics doesn't work.

89
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,039
I can write science fiction, right?

90
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,399
The wins and losses you mention

91
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,279
I do not care.

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,039
You know

93
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,879
Are you any worse than her?

94
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,599
A pioneering Experiment.

95
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,959
Requires the experimenter to have a spirit of sacrifice.

96
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,559
What I mean is..

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,239
even failure can destroy everything.

98
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,559
Nothing can shake her firm will.

99
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,199
But obviously

100
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,279
you are not the same. 

101
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,719
Rest well.

102
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,239
Mr. Tyler

103
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
The B436 project experiment has come a long way.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,519
No

105
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,599
It has gone too far.

106
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,799
I advise you.

107
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,159
Enough is enough.

108
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,919
Professor Luo,

109
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,319
It's so beautiful here.

110
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,199
Come have breakfast.

111
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,159
We are in a hurry.

112
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,719
Here.

113
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,919
There are opportunities in the future.

114
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,279
We have a lot of plans

115
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,359
and many places to go.

116
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,559
Thanks.

117
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,839
Is there enough butter?

118
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,759
There is enough.

119
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,239
How do you like london?

120
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,799
I still prefer Mount Fuji.

121
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,439
I think..

122
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,159
Do you get seasick?

123
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,199
Ok, but..

124
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,199
Pass her the spoon.

125
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,799
Thank you.

126
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,039
Thanks.

127
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,839
Brother Luo

128
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,719
almost done

129
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,639
Time to hit the road.

130
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,639
Just a moment. 

131
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,959
Take your time

132
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,439
If there is a place you want to go, just tell me.

133
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,719
I wanted to ask

134
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,319
what is my job?

135
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,239
It's getting late

136
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,119
let's get going first. 

137
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,519
I'll tell you when I get there.

138
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,439
Zhuang Yan.

139
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,119
Hurry up.

140
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,119
It's getting late.

141
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,279
Where are we going?

142
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,719
To carry out the task.

143
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,479
Ok.

144
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,759
Hurry up.

145
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,719
Luggage, luggage.

146
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,119
Where's the umbrella?

147
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,199
Come back, come back.

148
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,879
Watch me.

149
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,479
I will teach you.

150
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,399
Alright.

151
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,039
Help them quick.

152
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,359
Professor Luo.

153
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,559
Let's go.

154
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,039
For you.

155
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,839
Quick, quick, ice cream, ice cream.

156
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,639
The scenery here is so beautiful.

157
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,719
where does this even go?

158
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,199
When will we get to the end?

159
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,119
Professor Luo

160
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,719
For my work

161
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,959
can I go to space?

162
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,439
Do you want to?

163
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,559
Look here look here.

164
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,639
No problem no problem.

165
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,159
Professor Luo

166
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,279
I'm ready

167
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,399
huh?

168
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,959
Ready for work.

169
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,799
Can you tell me now?

170
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,559
This is

171
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,399
not urgent

172
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,679
You

173
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,039
should look for inspiration.

174
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,519
Shi Qiang

175
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,839
I'm going to kill you.

189
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,759
(Los Alamos: Where Discoveries Are Made!)

190
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,519
We have made history.

191
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,359
This time the model finally worked.

192
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,759
What's the matter?

193
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,639
Oh god what's going on?

194
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,559
This here

195
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,719
It's your nuclear explosion experiment?

196
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,239
What are they going to do?

197
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,239
Suspend the output module, quickly.

198
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,999
Don't move.

199
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,519
Why did he come here?

200
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,319
Who?

201
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,079
Ray Diaz.

202
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,759
How did this bastard get in?

203
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,479
Of course the Wallfacers can get in.

204
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,439
The largest nuclear explosion model is 20 million tons equivalent.

205
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,039
I want ten times this number.

206
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,199
You have to give it to me. 

207
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,399
This is a secret lab.

208
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,679
You are not qualified to point fingers.

209
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,479
Ok ok.

210
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,479
These people are scientists

211
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,239
Be reasonable.

212
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,119
I have a request.

213
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,679
Just do it.

214
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,479
Otherwise this laboratory

215
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,919
or a continent

216
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,479
or an ocean. 

217
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,399
I can make them disappear from the map

218
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,399
You could 

219
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,319
But, you'd have to make me disappear first.

220
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,839
Doctor. 

221
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,519
I haven't seen you in years.

222
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,079
You are still so cold.

223
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,039
What about you?

224
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,199
Still so rude.

225
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,199
Let's walk.

226
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,359
Accompany me to the Baisha shooting range.

227
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,559
You came all this way.

228
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,959
It's not for playing in the sand, is it?

229
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,119
So what?

230
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,199
I am wallfacer

231
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,519
You can't refuse me.

232
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,279
Look

233
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,279
the way he used brush strokes. 

234
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,719
It embodies the halo and sense of space.

235
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,239
Stand farther away.

236
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,319
How can anyone see a picture like this?

237
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,639
This kind of composition is stable and has a bit of fluidity.

238
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,039
Is representative of the Renaissance.

239
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,639
A unique aesthetic style.

240
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,599
Like me that morning.

241
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,879
Seeing your manor the first time.

242
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,999
viewing the lake. 

243
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,759
I like the paintings of this period the most.

244
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,039
Because it's

245
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,279
the first time painters

246
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,719
discovered the beauty of human beings.

247
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,479
What's wrong?

248
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,199
Professor Luo

249
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,359
You said

250
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,559
After the Trisolarans come

251
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,959
can we preserve our civilization?

252
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,039
I mean

253
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,159
is it possible

254
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,119
to keep these works of art?

255
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,239
Do you know

256
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,919
what shows our highest respect to a civilization?

257
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,199
What is it?

258
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,479
The ability to kill them all. 

259
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,319
To a civilization,

260
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,999
this shows the highest respect.

261
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,239
Look at that painting.

262
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,999
Is it..

263
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,079
Picasso?

264
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,039
This exhibition area

265
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,599
How could there be Picasso?

266
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,159
As soon as I saw her

267
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,479
I thought of you.

268
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,159
me?

269
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,359
Wallfacer.

270
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,919
What does she have to do with the Wallfacer?

271
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,319
There is a way

272
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,079
people can

273
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,599
through a look

274
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,399
or an expression

275
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,919
understand each other.

276
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,799
You mean

277
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,919
like the smile of the mona lisa

278
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,839
you can only feel.

279
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,399
Right.

280
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,959
This way people can escape Sophon's surveillance.

281
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,759
If eyes were so easy to read.

282
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,239
Then why would this be such a famous painting?

283
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,319
You

284
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,879
don't believe me?

285
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,439
Look

286
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,599
You get what I mean.

287
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,999
You are creating a

288
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,959
silent language.

289
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,119
Try it.

290
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,759
Hurry up.

291
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,759
Ok ok ok.

292
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,599
Then let's

293
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,319
try it.

294
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,199
Be serious.

295
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,039
Say whatever you think.

296
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,679
I think you 

297
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,599
are hungry

298
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,639
or planning

299
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,839
what's for dinner tonight.

300
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,359
Did I guess right?

301
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,319
How about this?

302
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,319
what do I want to eat.

303
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,119
No need to guess.

304
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,599
You eat anything if you are hungry.

305
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,119
It's your turn to guess.

306
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,879
You are worrying

307
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,279
how to give me a good job.

308
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,479
I'm not worrying about that.

309
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,719
You are..

310
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,359
worried that I can't do the job well.

311
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,479
Kind of.

312
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,559
what is it?

313
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,799
Can you tell me now?

314
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,679
I'll tell you when we get there.

315
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,719
Where.

316
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,879
The highest spot.

317
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,319
Mr. Oppenheimer

318
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,399
Right here

319
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,399
dropped the first nuke.

320
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,799
in 1945.

321
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,039
But after Hiroshima and Nagasaki

322
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,239
he had regrets.

323
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,839
No matter how terrible the weapon is

324
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,639
there are positives.

325
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,919
The most powerful thing in the world now

326
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,839
is the nuclear bomb

327
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,439
and ball lightning.

328
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,399
Tyler is one step ahead

329
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,079
you have to support me.

330
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,519
I can not do it.

331
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,159
What you want is too much.

332
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,839
We do not have a corresponding model.

333
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,439
You aren't telling the truth.

334
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,359
After nuclear sanctions

335
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,359
the whole world saw

336
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,639
the look on your face.

337
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,519
Building nuclear weapons of this magnitude..

338
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,399
it's a shame

339
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,479
that my lab

340
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,839
can't live up to your ambition.

341
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,759
Ray Diaz

342
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,639
Wallfacers and ordinary people.

343
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,719
Do you know

344
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,719
what the difference is?

345
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,119
The problem is

346
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,399
we don't even know what we have in common.

347
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,799
There is one difference.

348
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,999
Ordinary people see right now

349
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,719
but, I have to see four hundred years ahead.

350
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,999
To the point. 

351
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,919
your lab is too small. 

352
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,639
There's still not enough equipment.

353
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,799
Despite doing research in this shitty place

354
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,479
I understand

355
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,519
you wish the whole world knew who you were.

356
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,239
Similiary, 

357
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,999
the world will forget Oppenheimer

358
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,079
but, remember you.

359
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,119
Equipment is not necessary.

360
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,879
I just need one person.

361
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,599
A cosmologist.

362
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,679
Someone who studies the stars?

363
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,719
Why?

364
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,519
The 200-megaton nuclear bomb model you want

365
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,079
is beyond the scope of nuclear weapons.

366
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,199
Essentially

367
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,279
It's a model of a star. 

368
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,959
I'm very excited Rey Diaz.

369
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,799
Now it is clear the significance of this project

370
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,559
well beyond greater the supernuke.

371
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,799
I will become death

372
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,719
destroyer of worlds.

373
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,759
Oppenheimer.

374
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,159
The first time a nuclear bomb exploded

375
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,359
that is what was said. 

376
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,879
Ray Diaz.

377
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,199
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

378
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,599
what opportunity?

379
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,639
The chance to make a sun.

380
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,319
What we are doing

381
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,799
is creating an artificial star.

382
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,039
Ray Diaz.

383
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,839
Mr. President.

384
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,639
What's wrong?

385
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,759
call someone here. 

386
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,319
Yes.

387
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,399
Ray Diaz.

388
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,439
Verified by a PDC spokesperson.

389
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,839
Wallfacer Rey Diaz.

390
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,519
Is suffering from a disease called "Sunphobia".

391
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,119
The hidden mental illness of the Wallfacer is worrying.

392
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,999
It is reported that

393
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,999
some Wallfacers are looking for a psychotropic drug that can prevent them from talking in their sleep.

394
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,799
Is the Wallfacer project really what it claims to be?

395
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,599
It has become the last bastion of mankind.

396
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,519
Still unknown.

397
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,359
The scientific Advisory Boards

398
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,639
chief scientist of Computer Technology disclosed

399
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,679
the wallfacers plan 

400
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,399
for the stellar nuclear bomb model and the brain analysis camera requires computing power

401
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,439
are far beyond the the current limits of technology.

402
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,479
Therefore

403
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,999
At the just-held 89th Wallfacer project hearing

404
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,799
wallfacer Rey Diaz submited a request for hibernation.

405
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,639
This comes after Hines

406
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,959
to be the second to go the future.

407
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,599
Wallfacers are waiting for hope.

408
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,719
News from the Daily Verne.

409
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,639
Crisis eras third census results have been announced.

410
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,999
Global fertility rates hit record lows.

411
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,799
Falling into the lowest fertility category.

412
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,439
This just in. Breaking news. 

413
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,639
Wallfacer Tyler

414
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,799
and its research team

415
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,959
will go to synchronous orbit in the near future.

416
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,999
Beginning the ball lightning space experiment.

417
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,319
Tyler's research team claims

418
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,439
This experiment is not a real combat simulation.

419
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,639
So the strike target is going to be an unpowered spacecraft.

420
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,919
The entire experiment will also be operated remotely

421
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,999
to ensure the safety of researchers.

422
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,519
In addition, the research team revealed

423
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,399
the space electromagnetic launch rail is also under construction.

424
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,799
The launch speed of ball lightning in space will be greatly increased.

425
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,319
