1
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,799
After 400 years, the three-body talent will arrive

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,119
before that

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,559
live happily

4
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,159
live on your own terms

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,479
This is responsible for yourself

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,839
These two big living people can't stand it

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,879
Nothing will happen to him or Zhuang Yan

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,479
Thank you Mr. Luo Ji

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,159
I will remember the starry sky tonight

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,319
von neumann

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,679
Frederick Taylor's Wall Breaker

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,238
The B436 project experiment has come a long way

13
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,119
I advise you

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,439
Enough is enough

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,919
We just want to observe the energy redundancy after the ball flash attack

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,319
absolutely okay

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,079
Who's in charge here?

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,599
mr taylor

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,199
I

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,319
is your wall breaker

21
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,519
call the guard

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,959
kick him out

23
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,479
Monitor ball flash recovery progress

24
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,119
Remote display that Ghost 1 has locked the position of the ball flash

25
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,719
The ball flash was captured successfully

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,439
Recycling program is working fine

27
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,079
thank you sir

28
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,319
won't take long

29
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,799
Are you planning to create a

30
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,799
A space army armed with ball lightning

31
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,279
Is it right

32
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,639
pity

33
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,239
no one alive inside

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,839
Are you crazy

35
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,479
How could there be people on the target ship

36
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,719
Troubleshooting tracks

37
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,679
Start the return journey

38
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,639
receive

39
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,759
Thanks

40
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,078
last ground experiment

41
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,759
real target

42
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,079
Not that black obelisk

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,839
although it is beautiful

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,479
but you don't care

45
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,999
I noticed

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,519
Your sight is always intentional or unintentional

47
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,239
sweep those sheep

48
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,559
certainly

49
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,359
Yes

50
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,719
they are everywhere

51
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,759
but you're actually paying attention to their behavior

52
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,919
so that these are everywhere in the desert steppe

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,799
know nothing about vertebrates except eating

54
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,399
stay active near the target area

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,039
leave it alone

56
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,599
advanced laboratory

57
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,919
Then under your ingenious arrangement

58
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,399
Struck by ball lightning with modified spectrum

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,239
in the form of a quantum state

60
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,159
wall over wall

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,519
like a real accident

62
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,159
appear in the target area

63
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,559
so the sheep

64
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,119
Or

65
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,519
The quantum sheep attracted by the residual magnetic field

66
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,679
is your real goal

67
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,519
And that expensive black brick

68
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,639
And your anger at Dr. Elena

69
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,679
just come and hold me back

70
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,919
It's just a decoration for your scheme

71
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,119
your imagination is rich

72
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,039
but my enemy is your lord

73
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,319
not a sheep

74
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,199
Of course

75
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,119
So you visited Dr. Ding Yi again

76
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,679
elena is too young

77
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,679
lack of experience in space operations

78
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,159
I still hope

79
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,519
you can be my experiment leader

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,879
But you don't care about Ding Yi's reply

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,679
what do you want to inquire about

82
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,559
It is in the B436 experiment

83
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,879
Secret Records on Spectrum

84
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,319
and that

85
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,279
In experiments many years ago

86
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,879
woman who was declared dead

87
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,239
start recording

88
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,519
7 o'clock sharp

89
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,999
Instrument calibration complete

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,959
please confirm

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,999
Who is speaking

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,479
you won't answer idiot bogg's question

93
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,359
It doesn't matter who that voice is

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,159
How she "died" matters

95
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,559
almost time

96
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,359
Allow me to summarize your thinking

97
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,319
first

98
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,719
sheep hit outside target area

99
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,639
Ear tags are miles away

100
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,759
You are satisfied with the result

101
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,399
It can be seen that as long as the spectrum modulation of the ball flash is accurate

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,199
Organisms can not only be hit with precision

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,719
also in a quantum state invisible to the naked eye

104
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,519
survive for a while

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,999
And the handwriting that appeared after the woman's death proves that

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,559
Human beings can not only be quantized

107
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,439
also likely to retain self-awareness

108
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,439
even to some extent

109
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,799
impact our macrocosm

110
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,159
You abandoned morality to defeat the three-body problem

111
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,799
it's not easy

112
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,039
I express my sincere admiration

113
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,119
but also remind you

114
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,239
this

115
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,159
is murdering

116
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,639
War is a kind of killing

117
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,919
No

118
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,839
i mean kill your kind

119
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,879
i didn't kill anyone

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,319
you will kill soon

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,879
alarm

122
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,399
The base system is paralyzed

123
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,799
Ball lightning recovery procedure tampered with

124
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,479
Please troubleshoot immediately

125
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,359
Our communication system with the outside world has also been interrupted.

126
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,599
correct

127
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,799
Now the spectrum of the ball flash

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,839
It has been precisely matched with the human body

129
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,039
spectrum

130
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,039
What is this

131
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,158
This is a masterpiece just for you

132
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,999
Recycling process is automatic

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,798
panic what

134
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,918
restart the system

135
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,399
Contact PDC immediately

136
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,479
ok mr taylor

137
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,759
don't worry

138
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,359
four centuries is not long

139
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,559
in human history

140
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,719
not too soon

141
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,199
In the morning of the doomsday war

142
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,519
you can imagine

143
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,759
An average Space Force wakes up early

144
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,639
Hide a yellowed photo in a battle suit

145
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,439
this decisive battle

146
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,999
He has been waiting for nearly a hundred years

147
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,159
Additional load released

148
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,799
lead time path

149
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,079
Limit speed increased by 63.16%

150
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,879
finally came to an end

151
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,079
The night sky is gradually lit up by battleships

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,439
intuition told him

153
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,679
the battle begins

154
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,719

Ghost 1

156
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,839
Moving towards the ladder

157
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,999
please answer

158

Call Experiment Center

159
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,879
Ghost 1 has deviated 4 kilometers

160
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,959
can you hear

161
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,439
He took off in a battleship

162
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,599
In front of you is where all the soldiers meet

163
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,999
fire and blood

164
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,999
will shine here

165
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,239
he swears by it

166
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,039
his child is waiting for him

167
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,079
Long hibernation caused him to miss his parents' funeral

168
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,039
He doesn't want to miss his daughter's

169
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,759
target acceleration too high

170
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,319
It is recommended to suspend the docking order

171
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,359
ignore suggestion

172
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,239
Sudden

173
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,879
A beam of light hit his battleship

174
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,879
Butt fit 43%

175
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,079
Unable to complete docking

176
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,279
last he saw

177
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,719
are countless blue suns

178
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,279
you call it

179
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,119
ball lightning

180
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,519
Butt fit 57%

181
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,719
his last thought

182
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,999
Butt fit 72%

183
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,399
Did your comrades attack you?

184
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,599
Can he return to his daughter?

185
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,679
Butt fit 93%

186
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,359
Butt fit 100%

187
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,999
Docking completed

188
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,879
but these problems

189
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,439
won't get an answer

190
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,079
he them

191
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,599
cabin damage

192
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,479
Countless flesh and blood bodies instantly became human ghosts in the quantum state

193
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,159
Please fix it ASAP

194
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,839
give up docking

195
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,159
Measure the speed of the target ship

196
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,319
Now

197

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,959
millions of words

391
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,399
So fast

392
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,439
block message

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,759

Get in touch with Mr. Taylor's lab as soon as possible.

396
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,959
clear

397
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,239
The second team is about to arrive at the traffic hall

398
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,519
go first with extravehicular tools

399
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,799
gas composition analyzer

400
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,799
receive

401
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,319
quick

402
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,119
send to dr.

403
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,239
We need to get to the flight control center immediately

404
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,119
quickly sign

405
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,039
I go to the next one

406
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,639
pay on delivery

407
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,399
Yeah

408
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,239
hurry up

409
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,119
do you want something

410
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,519
 

411
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,279
I'll let it go

412
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,799
Automatic debit

413
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,879
Buckle up

414
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,919
don’t worry

415
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,879
the data inside

416
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,279
we are fully recovered

417
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,119
same as i thought

418
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,439
Your judgment is basically accurate

419
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,999
i mean you cut it

420
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,599
and what i think

421
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,839
as clean

422
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,879
I remember when I was in Daxinganling

423
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,679
The same goes for the stumps that were cut down

424
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,359
But the fracture is much rougher

425
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,159
Seems like flying blade is pretty powerful

426
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,079
your solar system defense system

427
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,839
Is it ready to build it?

428
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,959
don't ask her how she knows

429
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,639
last question

430
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,199
no other meaning

431
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,479
just to remind you

432
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,759
Humans can't control the power they have

433
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,639
in front of madness

434
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,879
reason

435
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,999
are weak

436
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,519
this

437
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,199
Isn't it just an example?

438
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,919
you

439
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,359
do you have any wishes

440
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,479
such a pity

441
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,799
My time

442
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,239
Running out

443
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,959
Don't worry

444
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,359
Your application to return to Red Bank

445
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,759
UNGA has approved

446
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,519
Thanks

447
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,799
or

448
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,399
Do you still want to visit your daughter's grave?

449
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,079
what i want to tell him

450
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,519
it's over

451
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,279
take care

452
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,119
Professor Ye

453
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,559
i lit the fire

454
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,079
but can't control it

455
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,919
the fire started to spread

456
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,039
i did what i could

457
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,639
Now

458
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,159
It's your turn

459
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,039
Although for them a few light-years away

460
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,639
nothing makes sense

461
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,719
but for me

462
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,759
is meaningful

463
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,679
We can only choose whether to sacrifice

464
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,839
but can't choose what to sacrifice

465
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,759
mr taylor

466
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,759
we support you

467
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,439
president say
