00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,439
Control center, please respond.

3
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,039
Ghost No.1

4
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,239
Moving towards the Sky Ladder.

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,479
Received, please respond.

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,559
Abandon docking.

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,319
Calculate the target spacecraft's velocity.

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,079
Dad.

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,119
Alert.

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,039
Detected damage to the main structure of Gravity Port 2 in High Orbit Ring 1.

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,119
Alert, the gravity system in High Orbit Ring 1 is about to fail.

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,519
All personnel, prepare for weightlessness and impact prevention.

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,159
Alert, Well No. 4 in High Orbit Ring 3 has been punctured.

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,079
Alert, large-scale explosion in the truss.

15
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,199
Alert, chain reaction of debris in spaceport.

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,879
Alert, major structural damage to the spacecraft dock.

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,319
Alert, disintegration of the main structure of the space repair factory.

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,239
Alert, all personnel, stop working

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,439
and go to the emergency assembly point.

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,559
High altitude station hit by space debris.

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,599
What's happening?

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,759
Chain reaction occurred.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,839
Stop moving.

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,399
Low altitude station's docking platform is forcibly locked.

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,159
What about that thing?

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,839
Sky Ladder cargo compartment fully locked.

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,119
This is the first time we have encountered this kind of situation.

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,359
All transportation and supply operations have been terminated.

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,239
What's going on?

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,359
Where did the debris come from?

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,479
Repeat, all personnel, stop working.

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,199
Listen to the broadcast.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,519
Isn't he at the high altitude station?

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,119
Shall we go to the assembly point?

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,079
Why do you have my badge?

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,239
Take me to the control room.

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,079
Hurry up.

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,039
Sorry, the control room is inaccessible now.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,839
Don't waste my time.

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,959
The wallfacer is up there.

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,599
Quickly.

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,439
Ok.

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,079
Follow me quickly.

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,959
This way.

45
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,799
Alert, the fiber optic data transceiver has been hit.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,439
Alert, All personnel outside the cabin, take cover immediately.

47
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,319
Stay away from the dense area of space debris.

48
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,439
Central axis electrical shortage.

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,479
Conventional lighting temporarily suspended.

50
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,799
Partial auxiliary functions temporarily shut down.

51
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,759
Team One arrived at the 3D traffic hall.

52
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,999
Received.

53
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,279
Now only short-range wireless communication is available.

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,119
Keep track of each other's positions in the space suit at all times.

55
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,599
Be careful not to fall behind.

56
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,839
Understood.

57
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,479
This cabin is the most severely damaged.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,719
Be careful during repairs.

59
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,799
Understood.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,959
What's this?

61
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,359
This is...

62
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
The gravity system in High Orbit Ring 1 has been restored.

63
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,999
F-ring and G-ring roadways.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,199
Cabin pressure is below the emergency limit.

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,519
All personnel, do not approach

66
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,999
or forcibly open the airtight cabin door.

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,639
Solar panel wing damaged.

68
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,679
Battery pack malfunction.

69
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,599
Power system has switched to emergency mode.

70
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,159
Are you okay?

71
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,559
Here.

72
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,159
You're not wearing your helmet.

73
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,999
Fortunately, nothing happened.

74
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,479
Young people are always careless.

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,439
Thank you.

76
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,879
I never expected to have such luck.

77
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,719
Let's go quickly.

78
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,959
What is this?

79
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,759
Where are we going?

80
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,479
Let's go, Wallfacer.

81
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,519
Why are you standing there?

82
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,999
I have never deceived anyone in my life.

83
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,399
Rest assured.

84
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:25,879
Come on.

85
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,439
Are we not waiting for the rescue team?

86
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,879
When will they come if we wait?

87
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,719
We can't even send signals to the ground.

88
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,599
Come on.

89
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,279
Don't hit your head.

90
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,599
Thank you, Master Miao.

91
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,439
You're welcome.

92
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,199
The fiber optic cable going up is not broken.

93
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,759
But there is only the Yellow River station with counterweights up there.

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,439
How much force can you make

95
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,559
with this small arm?

96
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,759
Go back and exercise more.

97
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,999
It's good for your health.

98
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,079
Chairman.


99
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,159
All wired and wireless communications at the high-altitude station are down.

100
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,759
Only the pre-disconnection data is available.

101
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,279
We are currently attempting remote observation.

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,599
But what about the damage

103
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,519
to the nearby satellites?

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,559
The truss has exploded.

105
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,599
The bottom fiber optic cable has been damaged.

106
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,319
The resulting space debris is being tracked

107
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,879
some of it will burn up in the atmosphere.

108
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,839
No.

109
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,039
I mean the top of the space station.

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,559
Where was Luo Ji's location detected?

111
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,359
Is this the location where the spaceship hit?

112
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,239
What about the images?

113
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,199
Emergency satellites from other orbits have been redirected.

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,439
The high-orbit light cone is changing trajectory

115
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,479
but it will take a long time.

116
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,999
Okay.

117
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,839
We need to know the situation inside as soon as possible.

118
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,039
Is there a way to get up there?

119
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,519
We can launch from the low-orbit station

120
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,359
they are closer.

121
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,039
Isn't Officer Shi right there?

122
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,559
That won't work.

123
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,599
The low-orbit station has also lost contact

124
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,599
and the air disaster will trigger their safety lock.

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,439
The Aerospace Department can send three

126
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,919
spacecraft to come closer

127
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,599
and directly enter.

128
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,399
It's currently the fastest

129
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,439
and only way.

130
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,839
Chairman.

131
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,719
That's impossible.

132
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,839
Chairman.

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,879
What's wrong?

134
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,719
Just now,

135
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,519
the signal near the high-orbit station disappeared instantly.

136
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,679
Above.

137
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,879
There seems to be an invisible shield.

138
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,239
Wireless signals are all gone.

139
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,279
Shouldn't be..

140
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,719
The spacecraft cannot detect anything.

141
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,159
How could the electromagnetic environment

142
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,199
of such a large area be destroyed?

143
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,119
What's going on up there?

144
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,959
Who are you?

145
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,759
How did you get in?

146
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,279
You stop.

146
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,200
It's fine.

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,519
Yang Gong.

148
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,479
They belong to the Ministry of Defense and Security of the Earth

149
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,319
I'm in charge of the safety of the Wallfacer.

150
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,279
Has the Yellow River Station also lost contact?

151
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,919
No.

152
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,559
But it's an unmanned nuclear power plant.

153
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,919
What the hell is going on?

154
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,199
You come.

155
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,039
Did you make contact?

156
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,079
I sent an email,

157
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,239
but no one answered the call.

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,199
Keep trying.

159
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,559
It's strange.

160
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,759
Infrared observations hit the target.

161
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,439
What is this?

162
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,199
I don't know.

163
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,639
Try using the imaging spectrometer.

164
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,039
Radio observations cannot penetrate the blind spot.

165
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,439
Reset the observation system.

166
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,279
No, no, no.

167
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,119
How can we see the high-orbit station clearly

168
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,359
from 16,000 kilometers away?

169
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,959
The observation system has already reached its limit.

170
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,079
Did PDC give any instructions?

171
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,159
We've been trying to contact them,

172
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,079
but communication keeps breaking down.

173
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,599
Yang Gong,

174
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,479
the signals of the top and bottom fibers are definitely cut off.

175
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,319
What's going on?

176
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,759
Let me check the communication module.

177
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,279
Dr. Ding,

178
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,559
to make a long story short,

179
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,159
No

180
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,479
don't worry about the ladder.

181
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,999
I need to say something more serious.

182
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,359
The satellite received full-band information before.

183
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,719
The maint point is that the ball lightning capture ship lost control

184
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,159
and deviated towards the direction of the ladder.

185
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,239
Chairman,

186
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,399
I request permission to publicly disclose the B436 project data on a small scale.

187
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,159
Granted.

188
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,439
Thank you.

189
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,479
I tried to speculate about what just happened on the ladder. 

190
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,959
It should be directly related to the ball lightning.

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,519
So what I'm about to say

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,679
may go beyond everyone's understanding,

193
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,159
but I will try to explain it as clearly as possible.

194
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,679
Ball lightning will choose a target to attack.

195
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,839
The specific frequency spectrum of the ball lightning

196
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,479
will only attack one type of target.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,799
Can you tell me if

198
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,879
the main body of the ladder is still there?

199
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,999
Of course.

200
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,759
Then the situation may be worse.

201
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,119
What does that mean?

202
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,639
Currently, the spectrum identified by the ball lightning

203
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,679
has only two types. 

204
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,439
At the molecular level, 

205
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,959
for targetting organic or inorganic substances respectively.

206
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,679
If the ladder still exists,

207
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,399
it suggests that this ball lightning

208
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,639
may be attacking human bodies.

209
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,319
However, the report shows

210
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,159
that this ball lightning has just destroyed its target.

211
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,239
Yes,

212
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,199
but the spectrum has definitely been rewritten.

213
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,999
Although I don't know how it was done,

214
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,959
at that time, 

215
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,279
the survivors on the ladder

216
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,879
should have been its target.

217
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,359
What will happen to them?

218
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,879
Professor Wang,

219
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,839
you should have guessed it.

220
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,479
Humans will resonate with the ball lightning

221
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,279
and be quantized by it.

222
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,319
The data she left

223
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,479
only wrote this,

224
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
but the fact must be more complicated.

225
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,839
Will the quantized people disappear?

226
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,959
I cannot answer

227
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,759
this question directly.

228
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,479
Our world likely exists in a macro-universe,

229
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,479
so

230
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,199
macro-matter will be randomly distributed in space. 

231
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,439
I previously participated in capturing macro-nuclei in North China.

232
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,799
Now, what was born on the ladder

233
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,479
should be a macro-electron.

234
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,279
When it reacts with the human body,

235
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,239
it spontaneously forms a complete macro-system

236
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,759
combined with a certain macro-nucleus. 

237
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,879
For now I call it a quantum body.

238
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,079
But, 

239
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,439
if a new system is really generated,

240
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,399
why didn't it happen in Mr. Taylor's ground experiment last time?

241
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,839
As you said,

242
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,039
the ground will not have it.

243
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,039
The high-altitude station is located in space

244
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,679
and is exposed to an extremely low-temperature environment after being damaged.

245
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,239
Under this premise,

246
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,519
the thermal motion of particles will be suppressed to a minimum

247
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,719
and can only move in a limited space

248
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,079
 to combine with each other.

249
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,119
Only then can there be

250
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,639
a bound state and a system.

251
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,319
But regardless of which quantum state,

252
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,879
it cannot exist stably

253
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,919
in the macro-dimension.

254
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,159
Unfortunately, 

255
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,439
this world is

256
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,079
not as simple as in the books. 

257
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,719
Countless sophons are watching us,

258
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,559
and regardless of whether the observer effect is strong or weak,

259
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,879
they will maintain the stability of this quantum body,

260
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,199
allowing it to retain its quantum properties

261
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,559
while continuously posing a threat to us.

262
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,079
that for us

263
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,679
 What does this threat mean for us?

264
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,999
You can understand

265
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,479
it as the ball lightning breaking the boundary between macro and micro.

266
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,919
The quantum body

267
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,279
it forms is like a fungus

268
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,439
infecting our macro world.

269
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,239
Once it starts to expand,

270
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,119
the entire space will produce changes that

271
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,999
we do not understand and cannot control.

272
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,359
So, are you saying

273
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,599
that the real disaster has just begun?

274
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,319
Is that right?

275
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,839
I can only say,

276
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,959
I hope we still have time.

277
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,439
The inspection of redundant items

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,879
has been completed,

279
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,039
and the terminal is restarting.

280
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,319
Please return to the cabin and conduct radiation testing as soon as possible.

281
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,079
We will soon be able to communicate with the ground.

282
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,439
Look,Yang Gong,

283
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,159
there is an aircraft near the high-altitude station.

284
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,959
Has the PDC started the rescue mission?

285
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,639
But the satellite signal has not been restored.

286
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,319
How can we wait for the rescue mission?

287
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,239
Once the platform is unlocked, we will hurry up and go up.

288
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,159
Chairman,

289
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,479
the rescue spacecraft has arrived.

290
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,999
Connect immediately.

291
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,799
Understood.

292
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,199
What's wrong?

293
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,279
It seems that the spacecraft's altitude is a bit off.

294
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,959
No. 2 navigation system is malfunctioning

295
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,879
and cannot avoid obstacles.

296
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,359
It is switching to manual operation.

297
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,559
This is the measurement and control.

298
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,359
Observe the surrounding environment

299
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,639
and pay attention to collision risks.

300
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,679
The first power distribution system has failed.

301
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,879
The propulsion system is malfunctioning.

302
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,119
Beware of debris,

303
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,039
take emergency evasive action.

304
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,959
It's too late.

305
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,759
Low altitude station communication has been restored

306
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,079
Sky Ladder Flight Control Center

307
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,279
This is Yang Jinbiao.

308
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,719
Communication just resumed.

309
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,559
We captured the air crash.

310
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,559
Chairman.

311
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,319
What should we do now?

312
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,879
Stand by for now.

313
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,199
I may have found some clues.

314
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,799
Chairman.

315
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,719
I'll leave first.

316
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,959
I believe

317
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,039
Where there is a will, there is a way.

318
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,079
Everything will be fine

319
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,239
So,

320
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,799
how do we get back to the ground?

321
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,519
We'll go back the way we came

322
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,679
The downward fiber is broken.

323
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,399
But the nanofilament is fine.

324
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,119
Otherwise,

325
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,759
The sky ladder would have collapsed long ago.

326
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,359
Don't worry.

327
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,439
The alarm didn't mention any damage to the transport module.

328
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,999
Don't expect any rescue.

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,319
Take the vehicle down the central axis.

330
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,719
I'll take you down.

331
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,359
If you see the PDC Chairman later,

332
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,719
Remember to mention me.

333
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,279
This is my work ID

334
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,559
Remember it.

335
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,679
Okay.

336
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,199
If you want something, just ask

337
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,439
I haven't thought about it yet.

338
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,199
Let's talk about it later.

339
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,598
Miss,

340
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,598
Could you please look around for the supply pack?

341
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,239
We'll need it on the way.

342
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,039
Okay.

343
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,639
No.

344
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,359
I'll go

345
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,159
She'll stay here.

346
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,919
You have to help me pull this thing.

347
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,799
You need to be strong enough.

348
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,559
I know where it is.

349
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,999
I'll be back soon.

350
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,719
Continue to calculate the escape pod's landing point in real-time.

351
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,519
All follow-up rescue operations are canceled.

352
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,159
What does that mean?

353
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,719
Chairman.

354
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,679
Aren't we going to rescue them?

355
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,199
Conventional rescue efforts are ineffective.

356
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,799
There's no need to risk more lives.

357
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,239
Is Ding Yi ready yet?

358
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,399
No news yet.

359
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,359
Chairman.

360
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,079
He's here.

361
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,759
Chairman.

362
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,239
Over here.

363
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,919
Ding Yi.

364
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,519
If you have a solution, let us know.

365
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,759
All the resources here are available.

366
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,719
There's no solution yet.

367
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,959
But there's a clue about this wireless communication blind spot.

368
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,079
Give me a split screen.

369
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,719
Received.

370
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,319
Hydrogen atom electronic orbit diagram.

371
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,079
Are you sure?

372
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,799
Yes.

373
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,519
this one

374
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,759
Use it as an analogy to this newly formed quantum entity.

375
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,079
I speculated earlier that

376
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,719
when the ball lightning spaceship lost control,

377
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,519
at the moment of interaction with the human body,

378
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,079
a stable macro nucleus

379
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,399
formed this new system.

380
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,959
It sounds a bit complicated,

381
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,079
but this structure is actually

382
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,039
similar to the hydrogen atom diagram in high school textbooks.

383
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,799
How do we verify it?

384
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,999
Hasn't particle experimentation been suspended?

385
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,879
There's no way to verify it,

386
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,719
but it's probably correct.

387
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,959
Because it's the only way

388
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,359
that makes sense.

389
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,519
We can do it now.

390
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,959
What?

391
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,399
Master Miao.

392
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,479
What did you say?

393
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,599
I said

394
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,879
The winch and guide rail are both okay.

395
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,399
We can go up now.

396
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,719
Are you ready to engage the brakes?

397
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,799
Okay.

398
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,239
Should we engage it now?

399
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,199
Master Miao.

400
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,679
Doctor.

401
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,399
Now is not the time to take chances.

402
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,039
Of course,

403
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,319
But the word "probability"

404
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,319
is the biggest difference between the quantum world and ours.

405
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,039
There,

406
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,599
all possibilities exist

407
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,839
and they exist simultaneously.

408
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,039
Like the hydrogen atom, a quantum body is in a bound state.

409
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,679
We can divide it into several layers of energy zones

410
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,399
based on the probability density,

411
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,279
which corresponds to the level of danger to humans.

412
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,079
The deeper it goes, the more dangerous it becomes.

413
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,799
The spacecraft we just saw

414
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,439
accidentally touched the outermost layer of the quantum body.

415
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,239
The outer layer

416
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,879
is where the rescue ship lost control.

417
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,559
Yes,

418
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,879
from here on,

419
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,959
the chaotic magnetic field forms a shield

420
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,639
that not only blocks wireless signals

421
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,159
but also damages electronic equipment,

422
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,439
cutting off all communication with those inside.

423
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,559
Is anyone

424
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,599
still alive?

425
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,599
You are asking

426
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,559
whether they will "die"

427
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,119
right?

428
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,839
First, tell me,

429
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,639
what do you think "death" is?

430
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,319
Breathing stops,

431
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,559
no heartbeat,

432
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,039
that's what you call death,

433
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,159
but in the quantum world, it's nothing.

434
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,079
In the micro dimension,

435
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,679
It can only be said that all the particles that make up a person

436
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,679
exist with infinite probability

437
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,319
spread out 

438
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,239
and diffused

439
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,199
until you are completely broken down

440
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,479
into elementary particles in the macro dimension.

441
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,879
Therefore, when facing a quantum body,

442
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,799
destruction

443
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,199
should happen unconsciously,

444
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,719
but from a scientific perspective,

445
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,119
the word "destruction" 

446
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,639
is not accurate,

447
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,719
because nothing is

448
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,879
really destroyed.

449
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,879
Momentum and angular momentum remain,

450
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,399
Angular momentum is still

451
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,119
just like a deck of cards

452
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,719
still has 54 cards,

453
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,759
just shuffled.

454
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,719
But life

455
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,439
is like a royal flush.

456
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,879
Once shuffled,

457
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,639
it's all..

458
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,479
Gone.

459
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,799
Are you talking about the people inside?

460
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,079
But..

461
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,119
You just said that this quantum body has many energy zones

462
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,719
with varying levels of danger.

463
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,759
Yes,

464
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,079
the outermost shielding layer

465
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,119
is the wireless communication blind spot you mentioned.

466
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,679
It doesn't harm humans much,

467
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,239
but it covers the entire space station,

468
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,839
preventing us from rescuing them.

469
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,759
The innermost layer is the core zone

470
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,159
with the highest probability density

471
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,199
and is most deadly to any survivors.

472
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,159
Is this just your guess?

473
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,079
It's a clue left by a friend.

474
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,039
I can understand her metaphor.

475
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,599
We worked together on Project B436,

476
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,119
so

477
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,559
in this area,

478
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,879
What the hell.

479
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,839
humans are doomed more thoroughly than in the usual sense of death.

480
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,679
I call the middle layer

481
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,919
of the quantum body the consciousness layer.

482
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,679
With a lower probability density, 

483
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,919
if anyone is still alive,

484
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,959
they might be there.

485
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,399
Do people inside the quantum body

486
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,799
see visible probability clouds?

487
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,759
Probability clouds should not be visible,

488
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,039
as observation causes the cloud to collapse.

489
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,879
But this time,

490
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,279
the observer is inside it

491
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,599
perhaps an exception.

492
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,119
In here,

493
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,479
so-called spacetime

494
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,159
will vanish like foam.

495
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,879
If survivors cannot collapse the probability

496
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,319
cloud through observation,

497
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,119
their macro existence

498
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,159
will decay infinitely,

499
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,159
a process

500
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,999
as natural as ice melting into water.

501
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,879
My eyes.

502
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,959
What's wrong with my eyes?

503
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,639
No,

504
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,639
I can't die here.

505
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,159
Zhuang Yan is still waiting for me.

506
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,919
But what worries me more 

507
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,679
is the high-speed movement of the macro-electron

508
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,879
which will cause a very strong gravitational disturbance.

509
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,999
In this way, 

510
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,319
the vicinity of the quantum body

511
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,919
is like spreading out

512
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,319
a gravity network that almost only locks the human body spectrum.

513
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,559
Even if the survivors can temporarily hide in a safe area,

514
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,479
they cannot avoid the influence of gravity.

515
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,799
What?

516
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,239
Once the macrogravitons start to fluctuate,

517
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,999
ultimately, everyone inside of it

518
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,159
will be captured by the quantum body.

519
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,239
What's going on? 

520
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,839
What kind of place is this?

521
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,359
Its existence is

522
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,959
not targeting a specific person,

523
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,399
but because of the corresponding spectrum,

524
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,039
you are within its range.

525
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,119
It is difficult not to be affected by the entire energy level.

526
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,559
How come only I am upside down?

527
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,399
No,

528
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,239
this is not normal gravity.

529
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,199
In this process,

530
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,279
people will slowly devolve into a superposition state like Schrödinger's cat,

531
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,479
which is both alive and dead.

532
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,679
If many of me are superimposed together,

533
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,039
I will see objects in multiple spaces at the same time.

534
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,799
No way. 

535
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,879
If one of me is a mirror image,

536
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,799
then what I see and leave behind

537
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,519
will also be a mirror image.

538
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,719
What happens

539
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,319
is entirely determined by probability.

540
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,559
What the hell? 

541
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,639
This is impossible.

542
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,319
This is unreasonable.

543
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,599
This is a space that breaks the rules of classical physics,

544
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,879
but it's not that this spacetime has changed,

545
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,799
rather

546
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,319
that many parallel spacetimes overlap or unfold at a certain position.

547
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,959
Is it a space problem? 

548
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,319
If I use astronomical observation methods,

549
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,679
assuming that the celestial body is at 0 degrees,

550
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,119
using right ascension plus hour angle,

551
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,039
I want to see...

552
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,359
It seems to be the hour angle coordinates.

553
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,519
It seems that below is the horizon circle,

554
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,399
and it is perpendicular to gravity.

555
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,359
Above is the zenith.

556
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,839
I just need to find the extension point of the plumb line.

557
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,599
3 star hours,

558
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,719
45 degrees hour angle,

559
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,599
then the right ascension position,

560
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,319
the observation angle is equal to... 

561
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,159
Is it wrong?

562
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,639
Or did I miss something?

563
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,879
Light refraction,

564
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,079
gravity source,

565
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,079
correcting altitude,

566
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,799
or maybe my assumed position is wrong.

567
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,039
Anyway,

568
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,199
It's all over.

569
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,039
None of the angles are normal.

570
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,919
It's okay.

571
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,239
I need to stay calm.

572
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,919
There must be a way.

573
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,679
I still need to take Zhuang Yan away.

574
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,799
There must be a way.

575
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,279
Take a deep breath.

576
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,239
There must be a solution

577
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,799
as long as I find the pattern.

578
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,839
I can't die here.

579
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,559
But you said that Zhi Zi's monitoring makes the quantum body,

580
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,319
at least part of it, in a stable state.

581
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,959
Can humans also survive in the same way?

582
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,559
You mentioned the observer effect.

583
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,879
Yes,

584
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,079
theoretically, 

585
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,519
it's possible.

586
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,879
All probabilities exist there.

587
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,639
Everything is possible.

588
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,759
Perhaps there is a one-in-ten-million chance

589
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,919
of a miracle happening.

590
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,479
What happened?

591
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,199
What's wrong with your eyes?

592
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,199
It's okay

593
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,839
Let's go.

594
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,799
Do you not want these things?

595
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,159
I've been looking for them for so long.

596
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,239
What about Master Miao?

597
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,759
Don't look back.

598
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,439
Hurry up.

599
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,759
What exactly happened?

600
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,639
Where it Master Miao?

601
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,119
What will happen to this quantum body in the end

602
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,159
if it cannot be stopped from spreading?

603
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,919
Our world

604
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,119
is like a still three-dimensional lake.

605
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,159
Quantum entities are like throwing a stone on the water's surface,

606
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,439
The more particles it absorbs,

607
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,159
The larger the phase space of the quantum state it needs to maintain,

608
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,799
Eventually,

609
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,519
The calmness of the entire lake will be broken.

610
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,039
No matter how deep the lake is,

611
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,479
It doesn't matter.

612
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,279
Anyway, sooner or later,

613
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,399
it will be occupied by the waves of the quantum state.

614
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,919
The fire alarm of the shelter has been lifted.

615
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,479
What's going on?

616
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,559
Please be careful when entering, staff.

617
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,639
Where's the master?

618
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,359
Report the problem as soon as possible.

619
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,439
You closed the door.

620
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,839
How will he come in?

621
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,239
The high-altitude station's first and second rings are severely damaged.

622
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,519
Is it because the elevator shaft was not repaired?

623
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,239
Or...

624
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,559
We need to split up.

625
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,599
We have been isolated from the rest of the rings.

626
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,839
Even if I can't help,

627
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,239
At least tell me,

628
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,759
let me know what's going on.

629
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,519
All the cabin sections here are locked now.

630
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,199
Let me help you.

631
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,719
No need.

632
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,199
There are only two of us left now.

633
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,239
We have to hurry,

634
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,559
Turn on the inner cabin signal.

635
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,479
No other survivors have been detected.

636
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,199
Please be careful

637
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,599
and use the escape equipment properly.

638
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,759
Luo Ji,

639
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,839
Don't be like this.

640
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,639
Okay.

641
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,719
Remember this red button?

642
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,999
It's used when launching.

643
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,119
Just press it.

644
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,359
There's a little bit of purified water here,

645
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,239
but not much.

646
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,678
It should be enough for you to wait for rescue.

647
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,279
 

648
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,919
What about you?

649
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,678
There's only one here.

650
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,359
When it's ten kilometers away from the ground, the parachute will open automatically.

651
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,079
And then no matter where it lands,

652
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,399
it will automatically send a beacon.

653
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,559
The PDC can receive it.

654
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,759
If you encounter danger after landing..

655
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,198
No.

656
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,279
If anyone has to go, it should be you.

657
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,678
Your safety is the most important.

658
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,959
My safety is none of your business.

659
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,559
What do you know about the current situation?

660
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,839
And what about Lao Miao?

661
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,879
I can't tell if he's dead or alive.

662
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,559
You kept saying you wanted to leave earlier.

663
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,399
Now that I'm asking you to leave, you won't go.

664
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,359
What else do you want?

665
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,719
Are you not satisfied?

666
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,039
I'm not dissatisfied.

667
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,198
I'm grateful.

668
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,039
You should know.

669
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,919
I'm asking you as Wallfacer.

670
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,879
I'm commanding you.

671
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,239
Go as far as you can.

672
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,638
Staying here is meaningless.

673
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,679
PDC has to listen to me.

674
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,559
Why won't you listen?

675
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,919
Right?

676
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,999
Remember.

677
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,439
When pressing this button,

678
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,559
just press it once.

679
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,039
Don't touch anything else.

680
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,039
The helmet?

681
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,079
There.

682
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,319
The life support system here

683
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,159
can protect you until you land safely.

684
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,239
You don't have to...

685
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,239
Escape pod launch successful.

686
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,199
I pressed it.

687
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,959
I'm listening to you.

688
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,839
If this is my last view

689
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,999
It's not bad,

690
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,719
Right?

691
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,839
You're good, Da Shi.

692
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,439
You really had me fooled.

693
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,959
I've been wanting to ask...
