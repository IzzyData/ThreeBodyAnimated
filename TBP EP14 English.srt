2
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,439
As the first successful wallbreaker

3
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,999
you are worthy of admiration. 

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,919
As someone who has been a wallfacer for so long

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,879
you

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,279
must have had a hard time.

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,239
As for finding someone

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,199
I have a way.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,679
Have you heard of the beacon tower? 

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,159
Luo Ji

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,879
There are only about 8 hours left until the ladder is fully covered.

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,839
It is impossible to break free from the gravity directly.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,479
You will have to use force to be thrown out.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,599
Do your best

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,399
Luo Ji

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,239
and leave the rest to fate.

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,359
Wake up quickly.

18
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,719
The current air pressure is stable.

19
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,639
We have

20
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,519
arrived.

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,639
What are you thinking?

22
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,639
I'm thinking

23
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,799
that as soon as I put on my helmet, everything went black.

24
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,479
Is this the true face of the universe?

25
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,079
Everything that is uncertain

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,279
has been filtered out

27
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,599
and all I can see are coordinates

28
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,839
and numerical values.

29
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,319
Is this what you hoped for?

30
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,959
I don't want this.

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,119
Why not?

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,919
Because I can't see you anymore.

33
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,319
Why do you have to see me?

34
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,839
To feel at ease.

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,399
Seeing you makes me feel secure.

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,999
I collapse when you look at me

37
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,519
according to Dr. Ding.

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,799
You don't think that

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,199
collapse means disappearing, do you?

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,759
Nope.

41
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,399
The quantum body is still there.

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,639
Don’t worry.

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,079
I won't let anything happen to you.

44
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,919
I feel like I've dreamed of this scene before.

45
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,199
Drifting in space?

46
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,719
No.

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,479
Drifting in the sea.

48
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,599
When I graduated, I felt like a fish thrown into the ocean

49
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,199
not knowing where to go.

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,119
But now

51
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,159
I've never been so clear. 

52
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,719
What do you understand now?

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,599
There is oxygen here.

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,999
You can take off your helmet.

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,439
Reminder. The helmet has been removed.

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,639
Do you understand what we need to do?

57
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,639
First, go to the spindle console

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,799
and release the nanofilaments

59
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,039
to make the Yellow River station rise.

60
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,639
Right?

61
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,039
Then

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,239
drive the nuclear power plant that needs to fly away to its maximum.

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,599
In this way, the quantum body will rise up until

64
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,199
the nuclear power plant takes it away.

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,079
While this is happening

66
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,119
let's hurry back here.

67
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,679
Am I right?

68
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,719
No.

69
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,919
No no no

70
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,839
this won't work.

71
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,759
What's wrong?

72
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,999
This place is worse than the outer ring.

73
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,799
We can't even open the backup power hatch.

74
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,639
How can we release the nanofilaments?

75
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,319
Is the PDC misleading us?

76
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,359
What should we do?

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,159
The nuclear power plant has electricity, right?

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,399
But we need to release the nanofilaments before starting the nuclear power plant.

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,079
Or

80
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,359
maybe we can switch the order of operations.

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,119
Generate electricity first and then raise the Yellow River station.

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,319
But if we do that

83
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,039
can we safely return here?

84
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,439
I don't know.

108
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,599
How long has it been?

109
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,759
10 minutes later than expected.

110
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,279
Normally, the nuclear power plant would automatically disconnect when the height is detected

111
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,639
but there is no response now.

112
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,679
What about the rescue team?

113
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,039
The platform can be unlocked and dispatched

114
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,639
but we have to wait for Luo Ji to complete the final step.

115
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,799
The backup power is also running low.

116
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,519
We need to start the nuclear power plant quickly.

117
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,159
Only short-range wireless communication is possible.

118
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,199
We can't afford to lose contact again.

119
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,839
The essence of the observer effect is the outflow of information.

120
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,639
The outflow of information

121
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,159
the outflow of information

122
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,199
information.

123
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,439
What if the quantum bodies get closer?

124
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,119
Remember

125
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,159
you have to activate the visual enhancement mode.

126
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,759
Didn't they say not to use the visual enhancement?

127
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,959
But then I suddenly realized

128
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,199
the visual enhancement image and the data of the spacesuit

129
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,359
are essentially our information.

130
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,599
Ding Yi said before

131
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,159
We must establish a stable connection with the outside of the shielding layer

132
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,559
If we combine short-range wireless

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,039
and long-distance fiber

134
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,759
we can enable the Yellow River Station to receive our information.

135
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,559
Are you going to use that

136
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,999
quantum observer effect that Dr. Ding mentioned?

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,359
This student is very smart.

138
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,039
Prof. Luo is a good teacher.

139
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,679
This may be the only way to survive inside the quantum body.

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,919
You should stay here 

141
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,679
and not go anywhere

142
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,439
understand?

143
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,799
I'll stay here

144
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,839
and wait a bit.

145
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,119
Why?

146
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,759
What are you doing?

147
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,919
We can't separate.

148
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,759
I've told you before.

149
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,719
Promise me.

150
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,479
I understand.

151
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,679
I remember every word you said

152
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,319
including the ones you didn't say.

153
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,399
You don't want me to be in danger

154
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,199
do you?

155
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,639
So someone has to do this

156
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,519
or else we won't be able to leave.

157
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,759
I'm not leaving you alone.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,439
When the quantum body gets closer

159
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,759
I won't be able to distinguish directions

160
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,799
so you have to be

161
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,599
my lighthouse.

162
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,719
Without a location, I won't be able to come back.

163
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,799
so you have to wait for me here

164
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,599
and guide me.

165
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,079
Okay?

166
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,439
You have to come back.

167
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,039
You still haven't given me what you

168
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,799
said you would regret not giving me.

169
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,199
Wait..

170
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,119
Did you see it?

171
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,158
So, are you saying

172
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,359
that you're willing?

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,439
I'm still waiting for you to tell me

174
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,839
what Goethe said.

175
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,559
This is

176
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,919
what you said. 

177
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,079
Don't go back on your word.

178
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,199
When I come back

179
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,999
don't deceive me.

180
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,559
As long as you're

181
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,239
coming back

182
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,119
I'll be here.

183
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,479
Abnormal increase in ionizing radiation detected.

184
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,279
Abnormal increase in magnetic field strength.

185
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,319
It came so fast.

186
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,879
How are you doing?

187
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,239
It was just magnetic interference.

188
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,959
Are you okay?

189
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,719
I'm fine.

190
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,879
I'm fine

191
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,079
I've arrived at the control area of the central axis.

192
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,759
I won't disturb you anymore.

193
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,639
Don't worry

194
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,719
I feel at ease when I hear your voice.

195
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,999
Why are you laughing?

196
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,519
Actually, I'm the same.

197
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,639
Wait a moment

198
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,599
Zhuang Yan

199
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,119
I am here.

200
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,399
What I'm doing now is..

201
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,959
If I go back, you have to testify for me.

202
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,439
It's what PDC taught me.

203
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,279
Would someone ask a Wallfacer that?

204
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,159
Yes

205
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,799
This must be part of the plan.

206
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,479
Really?

207
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,439
Normal operation won't work at all.

208
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,679
Just as I thought.

209
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,759
We have to deal with the nuclear power plant first.

210
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,119
Then you protect yourself.

211
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,439
Isn't it dangerous to operate at full power?

212
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,119
It's okay

213
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,879
just follow the instructions.

214
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,719
There's no other way. 

215
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,999
I'm starting now.

216
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,519
Wait, wait, wait, wait

217
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,399
what are you doing?

218
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,559
What's the matter? Luo Ji

219
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,039
Luo Ji.

220
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,519
Say something. 

221
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,959
I'm worried.

222
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,039
Zhuang Yan. 

223
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,599
I'm here. What do you want to say?

224
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,679
It's nothing.

225
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,919
How about we

226
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,519
just talk?

227
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,359
Now?

228
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,439
When you paint

229
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,519
do you prefer warm 

230
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,559
or cool colors?

231
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,399
Why are you asking this?

232
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,959
Anyway, there's only blue and red

233
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,319
so just go with your intuition.

234
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,519
Which one would you choose?

235
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,399
Okay

236
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,599
if you must ask

237
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,879
then it's definitely..

238
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,439
I know.

239
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,119
Yes.

240
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,279
Because I like

241
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,639
You like

242
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,599
the eyes of the sunset.

243
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,319
Why are you asking this?

244
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,959
Because

245
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,119
you will choose right.

246
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,319
The Yellow River station's generator has been connected to the power grid and is operating normally. 

247
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,239
It has been linked to the high-altitude transfer station's power system

248
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,559
The auxiliary nuclear power plant has switched to full-power operation.

249
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,479
What happened? 

250
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,079
The program has been updated.

251
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,319
In any case

252
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,679
The ladder has begun the counterweight adjustment state. 

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,119
You saved us.

254
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,279
The central axis main power grid equipment is operating normally.

255
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,719
The distribution systems of the ring roads are responding.

256
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,399
The ignition of the Yellow River Station's thruster is underway.

257
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,159
the operating orbit has been changed to detach from the auxiliary nuclear power station

258
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,959
The hydraulic braking system is unlocked.

259
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,439
The nanofilaments are about to be released.

260
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,679
Great.

261
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,999
We made the right bet.

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,079
As expected from a Wallfacer.

263
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,199
He did it.

264
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,519
Chairman.

265
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,439
The shielding layer of the quantum body is starting to shift

266
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,559
The low-altitude station safety system override is complete.

267
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,279
Immediately release the low-altitude station lock.

268
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,999
Understood.

269
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,679
The dock platform is starting to unlock.

270
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,919
The cabin pressure has been balanced.

271
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,439
System-wide self-test is complete.

272
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,919
Rescue No. 4 is ready.

273
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,079
Can you see the position of my spacesuit?

274
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,119
Come back soon.

275
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,879
Right away.

276
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,679
I can see it. 

277
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,399
Wait for me.

278
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,239
Luo Ji.

279
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,519
What's wrong? I'm here.

280
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,359
The quantum body seems to be approaching

281
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,719
You have to come back quickly.

282
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,599
What did you say?

283
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,359
Alert. 

284
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,479
The hydraulic braking system has malfunctioned.

285
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,039
Nanofilaments cannot be released.

286
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,119
Level 1 Disaster Alert.

287
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,559
The nanofilaments chamber is about to break.

288
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,239
The quantum body seems to be changing.

289
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,359
Can you hear me? Luo Ji.

290
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,599
Level 1 Disaster Alert

291
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,639
The high altitude station damaged.

292
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,359
The nanofilaments chamber is about to break.

293
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,639
What the hell.

294
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,359
Zhuang Yan.

295
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,319
Can you hear me?

296
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,199
Zhuang Yan.

297
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,959
Luo Ji.

298
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,999
Come back quickly.

299
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,919
How can we make it?

300
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,479
The safety disintegration mode failed to activate.

301
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,319
Both of us can't go down together.

302
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,039
The main structure of the high-altitude transfer station is about to be damaged

303
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,439
I'll go up and take a look.

304
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,039
Don't be afraid.

305
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,039
Wait for me.

306
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,559
What's wrong?

307
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,759
Electromagnetic disturbance detected.

308
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,639
Can't go up anymore.

309
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,479
Satellite detected.

310
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,119
The auxiliary nuclear power station has not yet left orbit

311
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,119
but it has stopped.

312
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,039
I don't know why.

313
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,679
Ding Yi

314
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,199
How could the quantum body get stuck?

315
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,279
The quantum body only moves along the magnetic field.

316
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,999
It's a problem with the counterweight station.

317
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,719
It's a problem with the engine room.

318
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,759
What's going on with

319
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,399
the engine room?

320
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,639
I thought the explosion only damaged the outer ring and truss.

321
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,679
It seems that the nanofilaments can't be released normally either.

322
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,239
Wang Miao

323
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,479
This is not the time to joke around.

324
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,719
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

325
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,439
The tension at the Yellow River station has continued

326
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,399
and the nanofilament can withstand it

327
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,439
but the engine room can't.

328
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,359
The structural material

329
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,399
has a tensile stress threshold.

330
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,039
If this goes on

331
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,679
the space ladder will fall apart.

332
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,519
It would be better if the ladder could disintegrate safely

333
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,479
but the comprehensive stress on the nanofilament and engine room

334
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,919
is likely to cause structural tearing.

335
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,519
If the high-altitude station explodes due to pressure difference

336
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,279
Professor Luo will...

337
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,759
Warning: The space ladder's counterweight process is forced to stop

338
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,399
Abnormal release of nanofilaments.

339
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,639
Please have a level-two engineer go to the nanofilaments engine room

340
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,078
to manually troubleshoot the problem.

341
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,039
Abnormal increase in ionizing radiation detected.

342
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,079
Abnormal increase in magnetic field intensity detected.

343
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,359
Zhuang Yan

344
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,479
can you wait for me a bit longer?

345
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,719
Please confirm if you are in a unsafe area.

346
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,399
I can't just ignore it.

347
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,839
Otherwise we will both die here.

348
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,599
Do you hear me?

349
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,599
Zhuang Yan

350
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,119
Current body temperature is 37.6 C. 

351
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,759
Heart rate is 168 beats per minute.

352
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,039
Please confirm if you are currently engaged in unconventional activities outside the cabin

353
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,239
and if you are in a unsafe area.

354
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,399
Alarm detected that the space suit is leaking air and losing pressure.

355
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,599
Please take immediate safety measures.

356
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,079
Alert: oxygen remaining at 65%.

357
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,599
Alert: oxygen remaining at 58%.

358
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,359
If time could stop

359
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,319
just one more second

360
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,239
either we will successfully leave

361
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,999
or

362
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,159
the diffusion will accelerate

363
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,719
Because what he is facing

364
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,679
is something we can't imagine.
