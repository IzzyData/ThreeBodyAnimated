1
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,119
You are planning to create a

2
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,399
space army armed with ball lightning.

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,679
Pity.

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,199
No one survived inside.

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,599
What have you done?

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,879
Did what you wanted.

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,399
I lit the fire

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,799
but I can't control it.

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,519
The fire started to spread

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,959
I did what I could.

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,199
It's your turn.

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,959
PDC Issues Latest Notice on Ladder Accident.

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,959
Ten days ago

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,839
Tianlai high-altitude transfer station located in geosynchronous orbit

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,239
was hit by accident.

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,559
Since the accident

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,319
the PDC launched an emergency response

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,839
to do everything possible to treat the wounded

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,279
and stabalize the aftermath.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,359
It has assessed

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,039
that the impact damaged part of the structure of the ladder

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,319
but did not significantly affect the continued construction of the spacedock.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,519
The ladder project has officially resumed.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,959
At the same time, The PDC solemnly expresses

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,879
that the process of human exploration of the universe is bound to be difficult

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,239
but we will overcome. 

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,799
We will never waver in our resolve to advance the mainstream defense initiatives.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,079
In addition, the rumor that the wallfacer, Mr. Tyler's, plan was exposed has attracted the attention of all parties.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,839
The specific content of the plan has aroused heated debate among the public.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,839
The PDC convenes an urgent hearing and makes a statement

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,519
that the Wallfacer Project must not contain any aspects that harms human life

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,599
and therefore disagrees with Mr. Tyler.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,359
The newly built space elevator is badly damaged.

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,319
ThehHigh-altitude transfer station structure is torn.

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,879
The spacedock is over 90% destroyed.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,719
Massive debris caused 132 satellites to be scrapped.

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,559
And within 5 years will collide with the space station.

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,119
This also poses a thread to spacecraft and outer space activities.

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,959
The cleanup of debris is in progress.

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,799
The overall progress of mainstream defense plans

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,079
has been delayed by about 18 months.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,919
In the accident

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,679
a total of 271 people died on the spot.

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,119
272 people.

45
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,999
272 people.

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,039
Subsequent impact is still being counted

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,119
It is clear

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,079
That this is a terrorist attack against the Wallfacer project.

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
The ETO agent codenamed "Von Neumann"

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,959
must take full responsibility for the accident.

51
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,879
No.

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,679
What he said is true.

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,359
He fabricated remarks

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,799
that fellow human beings will not believe.

55
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,319
In the name of the Wallfacers, we have

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,479
properly accommodated the families of the victims.

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,759
Soon after, the ladder

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,199
will also be fully repaired.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,639
The war has just begun.

60
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,159
Humanity needs you

61
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,279
Mr. Tyler.

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,119
My mission is over

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,479
madam president.

64
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,599
As I have said in the hearing

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,839
I have resigned from Wallfacer duties

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,399
and please

67
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,519
make my statement available to the world.

68
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,719
I can. 

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,079
Mr. Tyler

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,039
have you heard the story of Abraham?

71
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,519
The part on Mount Moriah.

72
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,719
We can only choose whether to sacrifice

73
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,119
but we can't choose what to sacrifice.

74
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,759
This is what you've been looking for

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,679
Mr. Tyler.

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,239
How do you respond to the wallbreaker's statement

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,159
Did you deliberately design the failure of the two experiments?

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,239
Is it to deceive Tomoko?

79
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,079
Is the wallbreaker part of your plan?

80
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
Do you feel like you successfully cheated the ETO?

81
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,719
What do you expect the ETO to do next?

82
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,159
Do you think there will be new wallbreakers?

83
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,839
Can you publicly refute the wallbreakers statement?

84
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,599
What do you want to say to the ETO agents?

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,719
Is Wallbreaker von Neumann still alive?

85
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,359
Can he be interviewed?

86
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,479
After meeting the wallbreaker for the first time

87
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,479
what advice do you have for other wallfacers?

87
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,239
Mr. Tyler we support you.

88
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,679
We believe in wallfacer Tyler.

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,399
Mr. Tyler.

89
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,159
You are a great wallfacer.

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,239
Where will you choose for your next experimental site?

90
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,999
Mr. Tayler.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
Everything is under our control.

91
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,239
What is your next plan?

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,159
Long Live the Wallfacer Project.

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,359
The catastrophic loss caused by the failure of this space experiment

93
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,679
Is Dr. Elena responsible?

94
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,519
Brother Luo.

95
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,879
Someone is looking for you.

96
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,879
Who?

97
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,719
I'll return soon, wait for me. 

98
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,799
Go ahead. 

99
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,679
I will just go tidy up my room.

100
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,319
It's so beautiful here.

101
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,199
Like heaven.

102
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,159
Yes.

103
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,959
That's all I want.

104
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,439
I'm terribly sorry.

105
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,879
We're fine.

106
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,279
It's in the past.

107
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,279
Don't mention it.

108
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,399
You are a smart man.

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,039
From a certain point of view

110
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,479
you are even the most responsible.

111
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,399
Me?

112
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,599
How can that be?

113
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,919
At least

114
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,159
you never hurt

115
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,159
the people who should be protected.

116
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,559
You are right

117
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,199
I came to you

118
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,039
because only we can understand each other's pain.

119
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,479
That person..

120
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,439
is it true?

121
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,159
He guessed right.

122
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,119
But it wasn't this that hit me the hardest.

123
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,879
After the wallbreaker appeared

124
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,039
the wallbreaker website made all my plans public.

125
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,439
The PDC also prepared to sentence me for crimes against humanity

126
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,959
but they said

127
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,399
the evidence

128
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,399
may be part of my strategy.

129
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,679
I will not charged.

130
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,159
Everybody gave me that smile

131
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,559
and declared the meeting closed.

132
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,479
I was completely devastated.

133
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,479
I rushed out of the venue.

134
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,159
Yelled at people in the square.

135
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,879
I'm wallfacer Tyler.

136
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,639
My wallbreaker

137
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,919
successfully revealed my strategy.

138
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,319
He is right.

139
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,959
I'm going to use ball lightning

140
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,879
to attack the earth fleet.

141
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,919
I want them to fight as quantum ghosts.

142
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,759
I'm going to kill, I'm against humanity.

143
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,919
Kill me, punish me.

144
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,799
The only result of this..

145
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,039
A large group of people gathered around me in the square to watch.

146
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,679
Their eyes seem to say

147
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,879
Look.

148
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,439
He is a wallfacer.

149
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,359
He is still working.

150
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,159
How well he did.

151
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,879
How much you pretend.

152
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,439
Breaker?

153
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,239
How can we see through his real purpose?

154
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,159
You laughed too..

155
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,759
The smile of a wallfacer. 

156
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,399
A wallfacer laughs at another wallfacer.

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,959
You also think I'm working.

158
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,559
a disguise..

159
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,439
Still executing the plan, right?

160
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,599
How did we get put in such a ridiculous situation?

161
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,039
Mr. Tyler

162
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,119
This..

163
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,679
I'm afraid it's a vicious cycle that we'll never escape.

164
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,679
I tried.

165
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,719
never escape..

166
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,679
No.

167
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,359
There is a way.

168
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,599
I'm here to tell you how.

169
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,199
You need rest.

170
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,559
Rest here for a few days.

171
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,199
I need to rest.

172
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,759
Can I stay here for a while?

173
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,199
You can do anything

174
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,599
while you are here.

175
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,999
Relax

176
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,279
for a while.

177
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,039
Join us for dinner.

178
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,319
Brother Luo.

179
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,599
Are you OK?

180
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,119
No way.

181
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,959
We gather here

182
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,639
for wallfacer

183
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,759
Frederick Tyler's daughter.

184
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,959
The death of Dr. Elena.

185
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,559
I offer my deepest condolences.

186
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,279
Greetings to my fellow human beings.

187
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,119
From human history to the present day

188
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,119
we have experienced countless catastrophes.

189
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,519
We have survived plague and war

190
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,799
and in the oceans

191
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,599
deserts and plains

192
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,679
we built an immortal civilization.

193
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,719
It was a rocky but glorious 3 million years

194
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,759
but on a cosmic scale

195
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,799
this is merely a moment.

196
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,239
No race

197
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,919
or any civilization

198
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,959
can for any reason big

199
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,119
or small, obliterate everything we hold dear.

200
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,679
so

201
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,159
at the moment we are going to discuss

202
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,639
not just survival

203
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,399
but dignity.

204
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,479
The enemy is present.

205
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,999
The wallfacer plan and mainstream defense plan will cooperate with each other

206
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,639
and take advantage of each.

207
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,199
This is a testament to the cohesion and vitality of human beings.

208
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,319
Now

209
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,279
the Wallfacer Project enters a period of submersion.

210
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,599
Under the threat of the ETO organization

211
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,879
humanities defenses are being eaten away.

212
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,439
The willpower of humanity

213
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,479
accepts the challenge.

214
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,319
We are not afraid of the challenge

215
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,559
because human being are between life and death.

216
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,919
We are not only individuals,

217
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,359
but an indestructible whole.

218
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,359
In the darkest hour

219
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,199
we must gather the trust of all mankind.

220
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,799
I firmly believe this time

221
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,599
Humanity will win.

221
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,439
The hibernation process beginning operation.

221
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,319
Start the PET program.

221
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,679
Strong NMR is on.

221
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,719
Brain scan.

221
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,519
Targeting the hypothalamus.

222
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,159
The wallfacer's sleep is not the wallfacer's end. 

223
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,519
We will rebuild the ladder.

224
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,639
It symbolizes that we can conquer all obstacles.

225
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,879
If mainstream defense plans were humanity's shield.

226
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,078
Then wallfacers

227
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,318
in our minds,

228
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,999
are a sharp sword pointed at Trisolaran's throat.

229
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,999
As the current chairman of the PDC

230
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,439
I will take the survival of mankind as the highest mission

231
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,479
at any cost to

232
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,679
protect our home planet from being violated.

233
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,399
I will lead you

234
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,759
to win this war.

235
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,999
Let the approaching invaders see

236
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,079
human beings may be small

237
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,639
but we never give in.

238
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,479
If this is the last view..

239
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,919
Not bad.

240
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,199
Right?

241
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,319
But you don't want to know.

242
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,999
Ladder

243
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,159
What happened.

244
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,599
Chairman.

245
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,719
How is the damage?

246
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,319
Ball lightning breaks down the boundary between macro and micro

247
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,319
This is impossible.

248
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,519
Innumerable possibilities superimposed.

249
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,959
What emerges is entirely determined by probability.

250
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,919
This issue.

251
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,839
Come out evil.

252
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,679
Them..

253
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,599
what will happen?

254
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,239
Don't look back.

255
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,679
I can only say

256
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,239
like Schrödinger's cat that is both alive and dead.

257
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,399
Are we underestimating the complexity of the disaster?

258
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,639
This is the true face of the universe.

259
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,239
Everything is uncertain.

260
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,919
At a fundamental level. 

261
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,359
It is only numbers.

262
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,999
Coordinate System.

263
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,559
So you're saying

264
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,119
the real disaster has just begun.
