00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,999
Renshougong
Shiyun Al J

2
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,439
be the first to break

3
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,999
you are admirable

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,919
Been a Wallfacer for so long

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,879
you

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,279
It must be difficult

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,239
looking for someone

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,199
I have a way

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,679
Have you heard of the Beacon Tower?

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,159
Luo Ji

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,879
There are only about 8 hours left until the ladder is fully covered

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,839
It is impossible to break free from gravity directly

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,479
Only by being thrown out by force

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,599
do one's best

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,399
Luo Ji

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,239
listen to fate

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,359
wake up

18
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,719
The current barometric pressure is stable

19
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,639
here

20
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,519
arrive

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,639
what's on your mind

22
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,639
I'm thinking

23
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,799
It's pitch black in the helmet

24
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,479
Is this the true face of the universe?

25
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,079
everything is uncertain

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,279
are filtered out

27
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,599
only see numbers

28
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,839
Coordinate System

29
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,319
do you wish so

30
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,959
do not wish

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,119
Why

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,919
then i can't see you

33
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,319
Why do you have to see me?

34
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,839
I feel at ease seeing you

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,399
when you look at me

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,999
did i just collapse

37
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,519
According to Dr. Ding

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,799
you don't think

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,199
Collapse means disappear

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,759
Nope

41
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,399
Isn't the quantum body always there?

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,639
don’t worry

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,079
I won't let anything happen to you

44
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,919
I seem to have dreamed about this scene

45
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,199
floating in space

46
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,719
No

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,479
floating in the sea

48
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,599
Feeling like a fish thrown into the ocean when I graduate

49
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,199
don't know where to go

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,119
but now

51
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,159
never so clear

52
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,719
what do you know now

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,599
this has oxygen

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,999
The helmet can be removed

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,439
Prompt that the helmet has been removed

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,639
know what we are going to do

57
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,639
First go to the spindle console

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,799
release nanofilaments

59
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,039
Raise the Yellow River Station

60
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,639
Right

61
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,039
Then what

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,239
Turn on the nuclear power plant that is going to fly away to the maximum

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,599
In this way, the quantum body will run up in a short time

64
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,199
until the nuclear power plant took it away

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,079
Let's hurry back at this time

66
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,119
back here

67
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,679
right

68
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,719
no

69
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,919
no no no

70
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,839
so can't do it

71
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,759
What's wrong

72
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,999
it's worse than the outer ring

73
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,799
The backup battery can't even open the cabin door.

74
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,639
How is it possible to release nanofilaments

75
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,319
PDC is not cheating, is it?

76
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,359
what to do

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,159
Don't nuclear power plants have electricity?

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,399
Then you have to put nanowires first and then run the nuclear power plant.

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,079
or

80
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,359
Reverse the order of operations

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,119
Generate electricity first and then let the Yellow River station rise

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,319
but in this case

83
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,039
can we get back here safely

84
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,439
I have no idea

85
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,119
to two

86
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,879
bomb

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,999
on the tube

88
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,879
don't want

89
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,079
Do not want any

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,639
--H+-- two
cities one

91
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,279
gone again

92
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,639
Captain Shi, are you cheating?

93
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,399
don't moan

94
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,919
face stretched out

95
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,559
Lumpy

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:41,999
guard

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,839
yes

98
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,359
it's me

99
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,159
Cantor

100
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,479
here to send you the files

101
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,879
part of the plan

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,879
this kid

103
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,399
Give me another life

104
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,039
quick

105
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,159
Hurry up

106
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,959
coming

107
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,359
Changan Deep Blue first reaches the future

108
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,599
how long has passed

109
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,759
10 minutes later than expected

110
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,279
It stands to reason that the nuclear power plant will automatically disengage when it detects the altitude

111
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,639
but now it's completely unresponsive

112
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,679
Rescue?

113
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,039
Once the platform is unlocked, you can go

114
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,639
But we have to wait for Luo Ji to finish the last step

115
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,799
The backup battery is almost gone.

116
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,519
We need to start the nuclear power plant quickly

117
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,159
Wireless communication is only possible for short distances

118
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,199
We can't lose touch anymore

119
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,839
The essence of the observer effect is the outflow of information

120
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,639
outflow of information

121
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,159
outflow of information

122
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,199
information

123
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,439
In case the quantum body gets close

124
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,119
you remember

125
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,159
you turn on visual enhancement mode

126
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,759
Didn't you say that visual enhancement should not be touched?

127
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,959
but it occurred to me

128
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,199
Visual enhancements and extravehicular suit data

129
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,359
Isn't it essentially our message?

130
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,599
Ding Yi said before

131
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,159
Must establish a stable connection between us and outside the shield

132
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,559
If short distance wireless

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,039
plus long-distance fiber

134
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,759
Let the Yellow River Station receive our information

135
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,559
Are you going to use what Dr. Ding said?

136
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,999
quantum observer effect

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,359
This classmate is very smart

138
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,039
Teacher Luo also teaches very well.

139
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,679
This may be the only way to survive in the quantum body

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,919
you still stay here

141
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,679
don't go anywhere

142
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,439
do you know

143
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,799
i stay here

144
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,839
Wait a moment

145
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,119
Why

146
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,759
what are you doing

147
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,919
we can't be apart

148
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,759
i told you

149
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,719
promise me first

150
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,479
I know

151
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,679
I remember every word you say

152
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,319
including unspoken

153
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,399
you don't want me in danger

154
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,199
Is it right

155
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,639
So someone has to do it

156
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,519
Otherwise we can't go

157
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,759
i'm not leaving you alone

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,439
After the quantum body is close

159
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,759
I can't tell the direction

160
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,799
so you gotta be mine

161
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,599
my lighthouse

162
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,719
I can't come back without location

163
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,799
you have to wait for me here

164
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,599
guide me

165
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,079
okay

166
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,439
you want to come back

167
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,039
You still have something to give me

168
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,799
Say no to the one who will regret it

169
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,199
A|^r Zq^r

170
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,119
you saw it

171
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,158
you mean

172
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,359
Do you want to

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,439
I'm still waiting for you to tell me

174
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,839
what did goethe say

175
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,559
this

176
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,919
that's what you said

177
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,079
don't regret it

178
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,199
when i come back

179
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,999
you can't lie to me

180
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,559
as long as you come back

181
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,239
You are

182
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,119
I'm right there

183
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,479
Abnormal increase in ionizing radiation detected

184
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,279
Abnormal increase in magnetic field strength

185
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,319
come so fast

186
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,879
How are you

187
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,239
It was magnetic interference just now

188
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,959
How are you

189
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,719
fine

190
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,879
I'm fine

191
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,079
to the control area of ​​the central axis

192
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,759
then I will not bother you

193
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,639
Don't

194
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,719
I feel at ease listening to your voice

195
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,999
what are you laughing at

196
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,519
Actually me too

197
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,639
Wait a moment

198
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,599
Zhuang Yan

199
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,119
I am here

200
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,399
what i do now

201
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,959
If you go back, you have to testify for me.

202
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,439
PDC taught me

203
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,279
Would someone ask Wallfacer that?

204
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,159
Yes

205
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,799
It's definitely part of the plan

206
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,479
really

207
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,439
normal operation doesn't work at all

208
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,679
same as i thought

209
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,759
We must first build a nuclear power plant

210
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,119
then you protect yourself

211
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,439
Is full power dangerous?

212
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,119
nothing

213
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,879
just follow the directions

214
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,719
there is no other way

215
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,999
i started

216
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,519
don't don't don't don't

217
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,399
what are you doing

218
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,559
What's the matter? Luo Ji

219
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,039
Luo Ji

220
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,519
don't talk

221
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,959
I am anxious

222
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,039
Zhuang Yan

223
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,599
I'm telling you

224
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,679
nothing

225
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,919
or just

226
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,519
just chat

227
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,359
now

228
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,439
every time you color

229
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,519
I like to use warm colors first

230
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,559
still cool

231
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,399
why ask this

232
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,959
Anyway, only blue and red

233
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,319
you just go with the feeling

234
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,519
which would you choose

235
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,399
All right

236
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,599
if you have to ask

237
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,879
that must be

238
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,439
I see

239
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,119
yes

240
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,279
because I like it

241
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,639
you like

242
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,599
sunset eyes

243
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,319
Why on earth are you asking this?

244
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,959
because

245
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,119
you will be right

246
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,319
The generating units of the Yellow River Station are connected to the grid to generate electricity normally

247
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,239
Already connected to the high-altitude transfer station power system

248
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,559
Secondary nuclear power plant switched to full power operation

249
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,479
what happens

250
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,079
Program update detected

251
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,319
Anyway it is

252
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,679
The ladder enters the counterweight adjustment state

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,119
you saved us

254
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,279
Central axis main grid equipment is running normally

255
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,719
The power distribution system of each loop is responding

256
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,399
Yellow River station thruster ignition work

257
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,159
The operating track is changed until the sub-nuclear power plant is off track

258
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,959
Hydraulic brake system unlocked

259
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,439
Nanofilaments are about to be released

260
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,679
Very good

261
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,999
we bet right

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,079
Worthy of being a Wallfacer

263
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,199
He did it

264
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,519
chairman

265
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,439
The quantum body's shield begins to shift

266
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,559
Low-altitude station safety system overwrite complete

267
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,279
Immediately unlock the low-altitude station

268
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,999
receive

269
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,679
The dock platform starts to unlock

270
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,919
The cabin pressure has been balanced

271
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,439
System-wide self-test completed

272
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,919
Rescue 4 is ready

273
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,079
Can you see where my spacesuit is?

274
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,119
come back soon

275
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,879
immediately

276
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,679
can see

277
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,399
wait for me

278
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,239
Luo Ji

279
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,519
what's wrong i'm here

280
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,359
The quantum body seems to be approaching

281
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,719
you have to come back quickly

282
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,599
What did you say

283
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,359
alarm

284
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,479
Failure of the hydraulic brake system

285
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,039
Nanofilaments cannot be released

286
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,119
Level 1 Disaster Alert

287
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,559
Nanowire turbine chamber about to break

288
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,239
The quantum body seems to be changing

289
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,359
Can Luo Ji hear you?

290
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,599
Level 1 Disaster Alert

291
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,639
High altitude station damaged

292
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,359
Nanowire turbine chamber about to break

293
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,639
what the hell

294
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,359
Zhuang Yan

295
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,319
Did you hear it

296
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,199
Zhuang Yan

297
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,959
Luo Ji

298
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,999
come back quickly

299
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,919
how come this time

300
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,479
Failed to enable safe disassembly mode

301
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,319
We can't both get in

302
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,039
The main structure of the high-altitude transfer station is about to be damaged

303
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,439
I'll go up and see

304
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,039
don't be afraid

305
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,039
wait for me

306
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,559
What's wrong

307
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,759
Electromagnetic Disorder Detected

308
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,639
Can't go up

309
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,479
satellite detected

310
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,119
The sub-nuclear power plant has not yet de-orbited

311
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,119
but has stopped

312
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,039
do not know why

313
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,679
Ding Yi

314
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,199
How can the quantum body get stuck?

315
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,279
Quantum bodies only move with magnetic fields

316
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,999
It's a problem with the counterweight station

317
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,719
It's an engine room problem.

318
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,759
engine room

319
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,399
what happened

320
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,639
I thought the explosion only damaged the outer ring and trusses

321
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,679
It seems that the nanowires can't be released normally.

322
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,239
Wang Miao

323
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,479
Don't be kidding me at this juncture

324
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,719
I'm not in the mood to joke

325
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,439
The pull of the Yellow River Station has continued

326
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,399
Nanofilament can withstand

327
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,439
The engine room can't stand it

328
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,359
Aviation construction materials

329
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,399
There is also a tensile stress threshold

330
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,039
tear it down like this

331
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,679
The ladder is falling apart

332
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,519
It would be better if the ladder could disintegrate safely

333
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,479
But now the combined force of the nanowire and the engine room

334
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,919
Fear of tearing the structure

335
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,519
In case the high-altitude station explodes due to the difference in air pressure

336
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,279
Professor Naro

337
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,759
Warning Ladder counterweight process was forced to abort

338
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,399
Abnormal release of nanofilaments

339
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,639
Ask the second-level engineer to go to the nanowire turbine room immediately

340
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,078
Manual troubleshooting

341
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,039
Abnormal increase in ionizing radiation detected

342
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,079
Abnormal increase in magnetic field strength

343
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,359
Zhuang Yan

344
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,479
can you wait for me

345
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,719
Please confirm whether you are in a non-safe area

346
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,399
I can't ignore

347
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,839
Otherwise we will both die here

348
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,599
Did you hear that

349
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,599
Zhuang Yan

350
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,119
The current body temperature is detected to be 37.6°C

351
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,759
Heart rate 168 beats per minute

352
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,039
Please confirm whether an unconventional extravehicular activity is taking place

353
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,239
Is it in an unsafe area

354
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,399
Alarm detects air leak and depressurization of extravehicular spacesuit

355
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,599
Please take security measures now

356
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,079
Alarm oxygen remaining 65%

357
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,599
Alarm 58% of oxygen remaining

358
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,359
if time could stop

359
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,319
one more second

360
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,239
or successfully leave

361
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,999
either

362
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,159
Diffusion Acceleration

363
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,719
because he faced

364
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,679
is something we can't imagine
