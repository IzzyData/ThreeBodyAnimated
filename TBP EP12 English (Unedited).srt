00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,239
Moving towards the ladder

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,479
please answer

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,559
give up docking

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,319
Measure the speed of the target ship

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,079
dad

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,119
alarm

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,039
Damage to the main structure of the No. 2 Gravity Port in Gaokong Yihuan was detected

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,119
The gravity system of the high-altitude ring is about to be paralyzed

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,519
All personnel are ready for weightlessness and anti-collision

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,159
Alert High Altitude Third Ring Well No. 4 was broken down

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,079
Massive explosion on alarm truss

15
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,199
Alert Spaceport Debris Chain Reaction

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,879
Alert of major structural damage to space dock

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,319
The main structure of the alarm space repair factory disintegrated

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,239
Alert all personnel to stop work

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,439
Go to the emergency assembly point

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,559
Space station hit by space debris

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,599
what's the matter

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,759
strong chain reaction

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,839
stop moving

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,399
Mandatory locking of low-altitude station dock platform

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,159
what about that

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,839
Ladder carrying cabins are locked across the board

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,119
first time this happened

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,359
All transportation and resupply operations terminated

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,239
what's the situation

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,359
Where did the pieces come from?

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,479
Repeat for all personnel to stop operations

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,199
listen to the radio

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,519
Who are you not at the high altitude station

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,119
go to the rendezvous point

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,079
Why is my badge in yours?

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,239
take me to the control room

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,079
quickly

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,039
No, the control room is now

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,839
What nonsense

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,959
wallfacer on top

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,599
quick

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,439
OK

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,079
come with me

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,959
here

45
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,799
Alarm fiber optic data transceiver terminal is impacted

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,439
Alert all occupants to evacuate quickly

47
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,319
Stay away from dense areas of space debris

48
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,439
Central axis power shortage

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,479
Regular lighting suspended

50
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,799
Some auxiliary functions suspend power supply

51
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,759
A team arrives at the three-dimensional traffic hall

52
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,999
receive

53
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,279
Wireless communication is only possible for short distances

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,119
Maintain the positioning between spacesuits at all times

55
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,599
Be careful not to fall behind

56
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,839
clear

57
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,479
This is where the hatches are the most damaged

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,719
Be safe when patching

59
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,799
clear

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,959
What's this

61
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,359
This is

62
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
The high-altitude ring gravity system has been restored

63
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,999
F ring road G ring road

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,199
Cabin pressure below emergency limit

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,519
All people stay away

66
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,999
Or force open the airtight door

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,639
Damaged solar cell wings

68
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,679
Battery pack failure

69
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,599
The power system has switched to emergency mode

70
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,159
Are you OK

71
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,559
Come

72
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,159
no helmets

73
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,999
Fortunately it's okay

74
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,479
young people are so-so

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,439
thanks

76
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,879
I didn't expect my old Miao to be so lucky.

77
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,719
let's go

78
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,959
This is

79
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,759
Where to

80
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,479
go wallfacer

81
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,519
What are you doing here?

82
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,999
My old Miao has never cheated anyone in my life

83
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,399
rest assured

84
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:25,879
Come

85
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,439
Waiting for the rescue team?

86
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,879
When will you wait?

87
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,719
No signal to the ground

88
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,599
Come

89
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,279
don't touch your head

90
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,599
Thank you Master Miao

91
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,439
You're welcome

92
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,199
The upward fiber is not broken

93
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,759
But there is only the Yellow River Station with counterweight on it

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,439
How hard should you be?

95
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,559
this little arm

96
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,759
go back and practice more

97
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,999
good for health

98
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,079
chairman

99
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,159
The wired and wireless communication of the high-altitude station is completely cut off

100
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,759
Only the returned data before losing contact

101
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,279
We are trying to observe remotely

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,599
But nearby satellites also

103
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,519
How is the damage?

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,559
The truss exploded

105
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,599
The bottom fiber optic cable is damaged

106
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,319
Resulting space debris is being tracked

107
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,879
some will burn up in the atmosphere

108
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,839
No

109
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,039
i mean the top of the sky station

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,559
Luo Ji's position appeared there

111
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,359
Is this where the spaceship hit?

112
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,239
what about images

113
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,199
Urgently transferred satellites in other orbits to the past

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,439
Cone of light in high orbit is changing orbit

115
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,479
but it will take a long time

116
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,999
good

117
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,839
We need to know what's going on inside as soon as possible.

118
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,039
is there a way to go up

119
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,519
Allows low-altitude stations to launch

120
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,359
they are close

121
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,039
Isn't Officer Shi right there?

122
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,559
no

123
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,599
The low-altitude station is also lost.

124
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,599
And an air crash triggers their security lock

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,439
The spaceship can't move

126
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,919
The Ministry of space can transfer three aerospace planes in close proximity

127
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,599
go straight in

128
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,399
The fastest way so far

129
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,439
and the only

130
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,839
chairman

131
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,719
This is impossible

132
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,839
chairman

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,879
What's wrong

134
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,719
that is

135
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,519
The signal near the high-altitude station disappeared instantly

136
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,679
above

137
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,879
It's like suddenly adding a transparent cover

138
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,239
wireless signal is gone

139
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,279
shouldn't

140
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,719
The aircraft can't detect it either.

141
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,159
Such a large range of electromagnetic environment

142
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,199
how was it destroyed

143
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,119
what's up

144
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,959
Who are you

145
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,759
how to enter

146
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,279
you stop

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,519
Yang Gong

148
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,479
They belong to the Ministry of Defense and Security of the Earth

149
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,319
Responsible for the safety of the Wallfacers

150
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,279
Has the Yellow River Station also lost contact?

151
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,919
No

152
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,559
But that's an empty nuclear power plant

153
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,919
what is this

154
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,199
You come

155
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,039
have you contacted

156
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,079
email sent

157
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,239
but no one answered the call

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,199
keep playing

159
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,559
strangeness

160
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,759
Mid-cut Infrared Observation

161
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,439
what is this

162
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,199
have no idea

163
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,639
Try it with an Imaging Spectrograph

164
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,039
Radio observations can't penetrate blind spots.

165
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,439
reset aiming system

166
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,279
no no no no

167
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,119
How can I see the high-altitude station clearly?

168
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,359
16,000 kilometers apart

169
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,959
The aiming system has reached its limit

170
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,079
Did the PDC have instructions?

171
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,159
keep trying to contact

172
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,079
But there is always a problem with the communication

173
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,599
Yang Gong

174
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,479
The upper and lower optical fiber signals are definitely broken

175
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,319
what happened

176
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,759
I'm going to check the communication module

177
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,279
Dr. Ding

178
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,559
I'll make a long story short

179
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,159
No

180
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,479
You can just worry about the ladder

181
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,999
i have to say something more serious

182
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,359
The satellite has previously received full band information

183
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,719
Roughly the content is that the ball lightning capture ship is out of control.

184
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,159
Yaw towards the ladder

185
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,239
chairman

186
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,399
I apply for a small-scale disclosure of project information B436

187
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,159
allow

188
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,439
Thanks

189
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,479
I tried to deduce what just happened when I got off the ladder

190
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,959
It should be directly related to ball lightning

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,519
So here's what I'm going to say

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,679
will exceed everyone's understanding

193
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,159
but i'll try to make it clear

194
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,679
Ball Lightning will choose a target to attack

195
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,839
Spectrum ball flash

196
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,479
only attack one target

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,799
Just to ask

198
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,879
Is the main body of the ladder still there?

199
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,999
Of course

200
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,759
that could be worse

201
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,119
What's the meaning

202
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,639
Currently recognized spectrum of ball flash

203
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,679
only two

204
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,439
at the molecular level

205
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,959
For biological DNA and inorganic substances respectively

206
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,679
if the ladder is still there

207
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,399
That means the ball flashes

208
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,639
It is likely to attack the human body

209
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,319
reportable display

210
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,159
This ball flash just destroyed the target

211
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,239
yes

212
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,199
But the spectrum has definitely been rewritten

213
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,999
Although I don't know how it works

214
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,959
that time

215
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,279
survivor on the ladder

216
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,879
should be its goal

217
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,359
what will happen to them

218
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,879
Professor Wang

219
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,839
you should have guessed

220
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,479
Humans will resonate with the ball flash

221
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,279
quantized by it

222
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,319
in the information she left

223
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,479
just wrote this

224
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
But the truth is definitely more complicated

225
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,839
Will those quantized people disappear?

226
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,959
this problem

227
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,759
i can't answer you directly

228
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,479
There is likely to be a macro universe in our world

229
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,479
so

230
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,199
Macromatter will be randomly distributed in space

231
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,439
I have participated in the capture of macronuclei in North China before

232
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,799
now born on the ladder

233
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,479
It should be a macroelectronics

234
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,279
The moment of reaction with the human body

235
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,239
combined with a macro nucleus

236
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,759
A complete macro system formed spontaneously

237
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,879
I call it quantum body for the time being

238
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,079
no

239
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,439
If a new system is created

240
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,399
Then why didn't Mr. Taylor's ground experiment last time

241
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,839
Like you said

242
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,039
the ground will not have

243
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,039
space station in space

244
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,679
Exposure to extremely low temperature after damage

245
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,239
Under this premise

246
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,519
Particle thermal motion is minimized

247
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,719
can only move in a limited space

248
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,079
combine with each other

249
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,119
bound state

250
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,639
There is a system to speak of

251
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,319
But no matter which quantum state

252
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,879
At the macro level, it is also fundamentally

253
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,919
cannot exist stably

254
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,159
Is it right

255
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,439
pity the world

256
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,079
not as simple as in the book

257
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,719
Countless sophons are watching us

258
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,559
Whether the observer effect is strong or weak

259
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,879
will maintain the stability of this quantum body

260
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,199
make it retain its quantum nature

261
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,559
and can pose a constant threat to us

262
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,079
that for us

263
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,679
what this threat means

264
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,999
you can understand

265
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,479
Ball lightning breaks down the boundary between macro and micro

266
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,919
quantum body

267
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,279
like a mold

268
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,439
Infected our macrocosm

269
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,239
once it starts expanding

270
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,119
The whole space generates what we don't understand

271
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,999
Uncontrollable mutations

272
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,359
so you're saying

273
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,599
The real disaster has just begun

274
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,319
Is it right

275
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,839
I can only say

276
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,959
wish we had time

277
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,439
Redundancy check completed

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,879
just checked

279
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,039
Terminal is restarting

280
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,319
Please return personnel from extravehicular operations to conduct radioactive testing as soon as possible

281
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,079
Will soon be able to communicate with the ground

282
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,439
old yang look

283
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,159
There are aircraft near the high-altitude station

284
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,959
Has the PDC come to the rescue?

285
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,639
But the satellite signal didn't come back

286
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,319
How can we wait to save lives?

287
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,239
As soon as the platform is unlocked, let's hurry up

288
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,159
chairman

289
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,479
The rescue ship has arrived

290
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,999
connect now

291
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,799
receive

292
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,199
What's wrong

293
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,279
There seems to be something wrong with the attitude of the spaceship

294
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,959
No. 2 navigation system failure

295
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,879
Unable to avoid obstacles

296
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,359
Toggling manual operation

297
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,559
Here is the measurement and control

298
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,359
observe the surrounding environment

299
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,639
Be aware of collision risk

300
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,679
No. 1 power distribution fault

301
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,879
propulsion system failure

302
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,119
watch out for debris

303
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,039
emergency avoidance

304
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,959
it's too late

305
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,759
Low-altitude station communication has been restored

306
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,079
Sky Ladder Flight Control Center

307
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,279
This is Yang Jinbiao

308
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,719
communication just resumed

309
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,559
we filmed the crash

310
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,559
chairman

311
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,319
What should we do now

312
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,879
Stand by first

313
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,199
Might have found a clue

314
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,799
chairman

315
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,719
I offline first

316
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,959
I think

317
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,039
There is always a way out

318
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,079
It's fine

319
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,239
That

320
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,799
How do we get back to the ground?

321
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,519
Come back as you come

322
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,679
Downward facing fiber is broken

323
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,399
but nanosilk is alright

324
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,119
otherwise

325
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,759
The ladder is down

326
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,359
rest assured

327
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,439
The alert didn't say the capsule was damaged.

328
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,999
Don't count on waiting for rescue.

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,319
Ride along the central axis

330
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,719
I will take you down

331
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,359
Meet the PDC Chairman

332
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,719
Remember to mention it to her

333
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,279
This is my job number

334
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,559
remember

335
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,679
Okay

336
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,199
say what you want

337
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,439
didn't think about it

338
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,199
talk later

339
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,598
girl

340
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,598
Please look around for a supply pack

341
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,239
we use it on the road

342
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,039
good

343
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,639
No

344
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,359
I go

345
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,159
she stays here

346
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,919
You have to cooperate with me to pull this thing

347
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,799
strong enough

348
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,559
i know where

349
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,999
I will be back soon

350
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,719
Continue to calculate the landing point of the escape pod in real time

351
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,519
All follow-up rescues that went up were withdrawn.

352
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,159
What's the meaning

353
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,719
chairman

354
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,679
Can't help?

355
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,199
regular rescue doesn't work

356
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,799
No need to put more people at risk

357
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,239
Is Ding Yi still okay?

358
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,399
no news yet

359
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,359
chairman

360
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,079
he came

361
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,759
chairman

362
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,239
my side

363
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,919
Ding Yi

364
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,519
is there any solution though say

365
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,759
This resource can be called

366
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,719
there is no way

367
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,959
But this wireless communication blind spot is a bit of an eye-opener.

368
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,079
give me split screen

369
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,719
receive

370
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,319
Electron orbital diagram of hydrogen atom

371
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,079
you got it wrong

372
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,799
No

373
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,519
this one

374
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,759
Use it as an analogy to this newly born quantum body

375
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,079
I guessed before

376
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,719
After the ball flash spaceship lost control

377
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,519
The moment of reaction with the human body

378
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,079
with a stable macronucleus

379
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,399
formed this new system

380
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,959
sounds a bit complicated

381
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,079
But this structure is theoretically

382
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,039
It is similar to the hydrogen atom diagram in the middle school textbook

383
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,799
how to verify

384
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,999
Isn't the particle experiment aborted?

385
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,879
unable to verify

386
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,719
But it's probably right

387
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,959
because that's the only way

388
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,359
just makes sense

389
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,519
ready to pull

390
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,959
What

391
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,399
Master Miao

392
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,479
What did you say

393
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,599
I said

394
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,879
No problem with the traction machine and the guide rail

395
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,399
we can go up

396
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,719
are you ready to wind up

397
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,799
good

398
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,239
pull it now

399
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,199
Master Miao

400
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,679
PhD

401
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,399
now is not the time to take chances

402
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,039
certainly

403
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,319
but the word probability

404
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,319
This is the biggest difference between the quantum world and us

405
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,039
over there

406
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,599
all possibilities exist

407
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,839
and at the same time

408
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,039
The quantum body is a bound state like a hydrogen atom

409
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,679
We can follow the probability density

410
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,399
that is, the degree of danger to people

411
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,279
Divide it into several layers of energy zones

412
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,079
The further you go, the more dangerous

413
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,799
The spaceship just now should be

414
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,439
Inadvertently touched the outermost layer of the quantum body

415
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,239
outer layer

416
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,879
That's where the rescue ship went out of control.

417
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,559
Yes

418
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,879
start here

419
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,959
The turbulent magnetic field forms a shielding network

420
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,639
Not only isolates the wireless signal

421
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,159
can also damage electronic equipment

422
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,439
completely disconnect us from the people inside

423
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,559
if

424
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,599
if someone is alive

425
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,599
you want to ask

426
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,559
Will it "die"

427
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,119
Is it right

428
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,839
tell me first

429
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,639
what do you think death is

430
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,319
stop breathing

431
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,559
no heartbeat

432
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,039
then you said die

433
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,159
Nothing in the quantum world

434
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,079
in the microscopic dimension

435
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,679
It can only be said that all the particles that make up a person

436
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,679
probability of their existence

437
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,319
amortized infinitely

438
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,239
diffusion

439
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,199
until you in the macro dimension

440
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,479
completely broken down into elementary particles

441
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,879
Therefore, when people face the quantum body

442
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,799
destroy

443
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,199
It should have happened unconsciously

444
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,719
But from a scientific point of view

445
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,119
destroy the word

446
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,639
not accurate

447
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,719
because there is nothing

448
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,879
really ruined

449
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,879
The momentum of matter is still there

450
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,399
Angular momentum is still

451
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,119
like a deck of cards

452
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,719
Still 54

453
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,759
It's just a reshuffle

454
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,719
but life

455
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,439
It's a straight flush

456
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,879
such a wash

457
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,639
nothing is gone

458
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,479
Gone

459
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,799
do you mean the people above

460
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,079
 

461
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,119
You just said that this quantum body has many energy regions

462
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,719
different levels of danger

463
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,759
right

464
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,079
outermost shield

465
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,119
It's what you call a wireless communication blind spot.

466
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,679
Doesn't do much harm to people

467
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,239
But covering the entire high-altitude station

468
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,839
make it impossible for us to go in and rescue

469
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,759
Innermost is the core area

470
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,159
highest probability density

471
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,199
deadliest to survivors

472
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,159
are these your guesses

473
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,079
clue left by a friend

474
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,039
I can probably understand her metaphor

475
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,599
We have worked together on the B436 project

476
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,119
so

477
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,559
humans in this area

478
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,879
hell

479
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,839
More thorough than death in the ordinary sense

480
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,679
mesosphere

481
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,919
I call it the consciousness layer

482
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,679
The probability density is not so high

483
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,919
if anyone is alive

484
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,959
maybe it's here

485
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,399
the person in the quantum body

486
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,799
Will you see a probability cloud visible to the naked eye?

487
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,759
Probability clouds are arguably not seen

488
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,039
because observation causes the cloud to collapse

489
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,879
but this time

490
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,279
observer inside it

491
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,599
maybe an exception

492
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,119
in it

493
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,479
so-called space-time

494
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,159
will be fleeting like a bubble

495
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,879
If survivors fail to pass observation

496
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,319
Collapse the probability cloud

497
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,119
his own macroscopic existence

498
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,159
will decay infinitely

499
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,159
this process

500
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,999
will be as natural as ice melting into water

501
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,879
my eyes

502
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,959
what's wrong with my eyes

503
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,639
no

504
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,639
i can't die here

505
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,159
Zhuang Yan is still waiting for me

506
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,919
I'm more worried about

507
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,679
High-speed motion of macroelectronics

508
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,879
would cause very strong gravitational disturbances

509
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,999
In this case

510
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,319
Quantum near

511
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,919
It's like laying out a

512
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,319
The gravitational net that almost only locks the spectrum of the human body

513
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,559
Even if the survivors can temporarily hide in a safe area

514
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,479
There is no way to avoid the influence of gravity

515
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,799
What

516
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,239
Once the macrograviton starts to fluctuate

517
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,999
eventually all of the above

518
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,159
will be captured by the quantum body

519
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,239
what happened

520
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,839
what the hell

521
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,359
its own existence

522
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,959
not for a particular person

523
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,399
but because the spectrum corresponds to

524
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,039
you are within its bounds again

525
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,119
It's hard not to be affected by the entire energy hierarchy

526
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,559
Why am I the only one upside down

527
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,399
wrong

528
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,239
this is not normal gravity

529
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,199
And in this process

530
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,279
People are like Schrödinger's cat, which is both alive and dead

531
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,479
Slowly evolve into a superposition state

532
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,679
If many I stack together

533
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,039
You can see objects in multiple spaces at the same time

534
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,799
No way

535
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,879
if one of i is mirrored

536
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,799
the traces that I saw and left

537
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,519
will also be mirrored

538
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,719
what happened

539
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,319
completely determined by probability

540
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,559
what the hell

541
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,639
This is impossible

542
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,319
it's unreasonable

543
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,599
This is a space that breaks the rules of classical physics

544
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,879
But it's not that time and space have changed

545
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,799
but

546
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,319
Many parallel time and space overlap or expand at a certain position

547
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,959
Is it a matter of space?

548
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,319
If using astronomical observation methods

549
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,679
Assume the celestial body is 0 degrees

550
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,119
time angle with right ascension

551
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,039
I want to see

552
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,359
true hour coordinates

553
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,519
It looks like the horizon is below

554
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,399
and perpendicular to gravity

555
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,359
above is the zenith

556
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,839
I just need to find the extension point of the plumb line

557
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,599
3 sidereal hours

558
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,719
45 degree hour angle

559
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,599
that right ascension position

560
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,319
viewing angle equal to

561
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,159
right?

562
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,639
or am i missing something

563
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,879
light refraction

564
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,079
gravitational source

565
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,079
corrected altitude

566
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,799
Or am I assuming the wrong location?

567
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,039
do not care

568
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,199
Ruined

569
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,039
no angle is normal

570
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,919
fine

571
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,239
i want to calm down

572
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,919
there is always a way

573
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,679
I have to take Zhuang Yan away

574
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,799
there must be a way

575
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,279
take a deep breath

576
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,239
there must be a way out

577
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,799
just find the pattern

578
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,839
i can't die here

579
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,559
But you said that sophon surveillance allows the quantum

580
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,319
At least part of it is in a stable state

581
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,959
Can humans survive in the same way?

582
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,559
you say the observer effect

583
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,879
yes

584
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,079
theoretically possible

585
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,519
I can only say

586
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,879
If all probabilities exist there

587
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,639
anything is possible

588
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,759
There might be a one in a million chance

589
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,919
is a miracle happened

590
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,479
what happens

591
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,199
what's wrong with your eyes

592
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,199
fine

593
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,839
Walk

594
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,799
Don't you want something?

595
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,159
I have been looking for a long time

596
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,239
Where's Master Miao?

597
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,759
don't look back

598
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,439
go quickly

599
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,759
In the end what happened

600
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,639
Is it Master Miao?

601
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,119
What will happen to this quantum body in the end?

602
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,159
If it doesn't stop it from spreading

603
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,919
our world

604
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,119
It's just a still three-dimensional lake.

605
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,159
The quantum body is like throwing a stone on the water

606
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,439
The more particles it absorbs

607
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,159
The phase space of the quantum state that needs to be maintained is larger

608
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,799
at last

609
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,519
The calm of the entire lake will be broken

610
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,039
No matter how deep the ladder is

611
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,479
no difference

612
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,279
anyway sooner or later

613
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,399
will be occupied by waves of the quantum state

614
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,919
Shelter fire alarm has been lifted

615
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,479
what happened

616
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,559
Please enter carefully

617
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,639
Where is the master?

618
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,359
Repair as soon as possible

619
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,439
you close the door

620
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,839
how did he get in

621
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,239
High-altitude station ring road 1 and ring road 2 were seriously damaged

622
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,519
Is it the elevator shaft that hasn't been repaired?

623
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,239
still

624
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,559
we are going to split up

625
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,599
Isolated from the rest of the ring

626
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,839
even if i can't help

627
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,239
at least tell me

628
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,759
let me know what's going on

629
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,519
Now the compartments here are all locked.

630
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,199
let me help you

631
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,719
Need not

632
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,199
now it's just the two of us

633
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,239
gotta go

634
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,559
In addition to the internal service signal

635
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,479
No other survivors detected

636
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,199
Please be careful

637
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,599
Regulate the use of escape equipment

638
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,759
Luo Ji

639
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,839
don't do this

640
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,639
alright

641
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,719
Remember this red button

642
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,999
used for launch

643
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,119
just press it

644
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,359
this is a bit of pure water

645
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,239
but not much

646
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,678
Should be enough for when you're waiting for rescue

647
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,279
 

648
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,919
what would you do

649
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,678
there is only one

650
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,359
When it is ten kilometers above the ground, it will open a parachute

651
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,079
No matter where you land after that

652
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,399
will automatically send a beacon

653
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,559
PDC can receive ij

654
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,759
In case of danger after landing

655
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,198
no

656
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,279
If you want to go, you go

657
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,678
your safest

658
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,959
my safety is none of your business

659
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,559
Do you know what's going on now?

660
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,839
That Lao Miao

661
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,879
I can't even tell if he's dead or not.

662
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,559
Didn't you just keep saying you were leaving?

663
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,399
I let you go now and you don't go

664
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,359
what else do you want

665
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,719
what are you dissatisfied with

666
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,039
I'm not dissatisfied

667
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,198
I appreciate it

668
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,039
you figured it out

669
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,919
I ask you as a wallfacer

670
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,879
i am ordering you

671
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,239
Roll as far as you can

672
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,638
Laying here doesn't make any sense

673
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,679
PDC has to listen to me

674
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,559
why don't you listen

675
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,919
Right

676
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,999
remember

677
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,439
except pressing this button

678
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,559
just click

679
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,039
don't touch anything else

680
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,039
Helmet?

681
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,079
there

682
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,319
circulatory system here

683
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,159
Fully protects you until a safe landing on the ground

684
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,239
you do not need

685
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,239
Escape pod launched successfully

686
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,199
i pressed

687
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,959
Listen to you

688
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,839
if this is the last view

689
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,999
not bad

690
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,719
Is it right

691
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,839
Yes Dashi

692
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,439
I'm really blinded by you

693
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,959
i always wanted to ask
