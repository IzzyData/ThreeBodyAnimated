00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,879
Professor Luo

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,279
What kind of work will you arrange for me?

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,199
You are contradictory.

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,399
Mr. Tyler.

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,399
Macroelectrons need artificial lightning for excitation.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,759
Only then will it have all the attributes of a quantum state weapon.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,959
Dr. Ding

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,359
I still hope

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,599
you can lead my experiment.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,399
No need to

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,719
This experiment will fail.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,479
The B436 project experiment has gone too far.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,559
I advise you

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,919
enough is enough.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,559
Von Neumann

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,879
Frederick Tyler's Wall Breaker

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,159
Brother Luo

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,959
Are you resting?

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,879
Time to go.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,639
Not yet.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,399
Wait a while.

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,919
Slow down slow down.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,799
Close call close call.

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,479
Traffic lights ahead.

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,039
What?

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,959
Luo Ji.

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,919
There's a car ahead, slow down.

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,839
Brake now.

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,879
Change lanes.

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,319
This kid..

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,239
Slightly to the right.

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,479
Do you want more?

35
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,679
Change lanes.

36
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,879
Turn on the right turn signal.

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,759
The optimal route has been re-planned.

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,639
Please continue on the road to the right.

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,799
There's a car ahead, slow down.

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,799
Hit the brakes.

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,359
Should we get gas?

42
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,479
Turn left turn left.

43
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,439
A little slower.

44
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,759
The current road condition is good.

45
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,519
It is recommended to turn on the Changan Zhuge intelligent driving assistance setting. 

46
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,879
In order to ensure the supplementary tasks of various scientific research materials for high-altitude stations

47
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,399
the ground operation center will optimize the logistics data model in the near future.

48
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,759
I said, what do they eat?

49
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,199
The two living people can't stand it

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,399
I just need to go to the bathroom.

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,559
Turn around and run away.

52
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,639
Eyes act as light bulbs

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,159
If I don't ask people, I will go to Trisolaran

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,399
Haven't found them yet?

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,079
Them. 

56
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,039
Him and Zhuang Yan.

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,239
Nothing can happen to them. 

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,959
Found them. 

59
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,079
I sent you their location. 

60
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,719
I'm sorry Mr. Shi. 

61
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,279
It's..

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,159
It's all gone wrong. 

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,599
You're dead when I come back.

64
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,559
Hurry up and find the person in charge here.

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,919
I'm going in now.

66
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,719
Inspection failed

67
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,479
The wallfacer is top priority.

68
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,199
I know.

69
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,439
Be sure not to let civilians mix in.

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,559
Where is the person in charge of this cabin?

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,279
Bring him here right away.

72
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,079
I am.

73
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,879
Who are you?

74
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,879
That line.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,719
I am that.

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,839
Ministry of Earth Defense and Security.

77
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,759

Badge. 

80
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,599
Didn't you answer all my calls?

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,559
Didn't I make it clear?

82
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,079
These unlucky bastards

83
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,799
people can't stand it.

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,879
I can't even say a thing. 

85
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,759
Sorry.

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,319
No badge no entry. 

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,759

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,439
I talked to you over the phone. 

91
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,599
I am Shi Qiang.

92
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,439
Stop me.

93
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,519
Who is responsible for the safety of Wallfacer Luo Ji?

94
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,319
You?

95
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,719
Can you manage it?

96
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,159
Sorry sorry.

97
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,559
Mr. Shi. 

98
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,599
I'm really sorry.

99
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,359
Go, quickly. 

100
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,959
As soon as I got the call from PDC

101
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,879
I came here right away.

102
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,279
Stop talking nonsense and hurry up.

103
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,879
Ok ok ok. 

104
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,759
Ready to go. 

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,639
Where is my seat?

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,759
Mr. Shi please this way.

107
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,279
We have prepared temporary VIP seat for you.

Please confirm the safety protection device in the cabin.

112
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,119
Strictly abide by space transportation safety regulations.

113
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,079
What kind of VIP..

114
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,439
The carrier cabin has entered the second stage of acceleration.

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,159
Maximum acceleration.

116
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,079
Please adjust your sitting posture.

117
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,639
Rake a deep breath.

Confirmed.

156
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,999
Ghost 1 is on the preset track.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,599
Go to target attack position.

158
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,159
What happened?

159
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,559
I changed it.

160
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,759
We just want to observe the energy redundancy after the ball lightning attack.

161
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,679
It's absolutely safe.

162
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,119
Do you really think it's an experiment?

163
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,799
This is preparation for war.

164
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,919
Dr. Elena

165
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,839
Even children have to face the three-body crisis.

166
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,279
Why do you talk about safety?

167
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,999
But the alternate abort procedure..

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,839
Who's in charge here?

169
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,599
You.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,799
Mr. Tyler.

171
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,639
If it weren't for the fact that I'm a Wallfacer

172
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,119
You wouldn't have the chance to be here.

173
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,639
All departments.

174
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,079
Restore original values.

175
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,119
The trigger has been rolled back.

176
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,599

177
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,399
Hey, brother.

178
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,559
How long do we have until the top ring?

179
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,719
Brother.

203
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,759
Please note

204
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,479
The carrier cabin is about to arrive at the high-altitude transfer station.

For your safety

206
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,239
before the carrier cabin comes to a complete stop

207
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,959
do not disengage the safety device.

208
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,479

Tianti No. 1 Observation Platform. 

402
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,439
Located on the outer edge of the first ring road of Gaokong Station.

403
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,279
A variety of surface plants are cultivated here.

404
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,399
Research on space mutation and breeding

405
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,559
at the same time

406
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,559
can help people who work in the cabin for a long time

407
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,479
fight claustrophobia,

408
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,399
depression and fatigue.

409
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,959
It's sad.

410
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,359
Such a beautiful universe

411
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,159
and no one will see it.

412
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,719
Think about it like this. 

413
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,279
Trisolarans are living beings too.

414
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,439
I don't think they are good.

415
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,159
So I can't feel the beauty.

416
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,079
Their strategy against humans

417
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,839
is a rational choice.

418
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,399
It is a responsible approach to the survival of one's own race.

419
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,559
It is not about good or evil.

420
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,879
Will you meet the Trisolarans in the

421
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,759
future?

422
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,719
Maybe.

423
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,639
If..

424
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,039
I mean..

425
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,839
If you really beat them

426
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,799
Can you?

427
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,319
Not kill all of them?

428
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,559
Give them a place

429
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,279
to live with us.

430
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,279
Zhuang Yan.

431
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,679
I sometimes feel

432
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,719
If there's real possibility of saving the world.

433
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,399
It's you.

434
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,319
I'm not a Wallfacer.

435
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,599
I'm serious.

436
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,639
If there were more people like you.

437
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,159
It would really possible for the Three-Body Civilization to negotiate with us

438
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,719
instead of immediately declaring war.

439
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,639
Really?

440
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,319
So..

441
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,119
can you tell me now

442
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,999
what my job is?

443
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,959
Actually

444
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,679
your work has already begun.

445
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,599
Really?

446
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,039
But..

447
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,839
but I didn't do anything.

448
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,999
Be happy.

449
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,959
Use this time 

450
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,239
to make yourself happy.

451
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,919
This is your job.

452
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,519
About to arrive at the destination

453
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,159
2718 Space Experiment Base.

454
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,559
Are you

455
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,199
really a wallfacer?

456
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,399
Of course.

457
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,439
You just want to eat, drink and be happy every day?

458
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,559
that's it?

459
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,639
It's important.

460
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,639
Think about it.

461
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,279
It is obvious that in 400 years the Three-Body Problem will arrive

462
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,719
but, people are already living in the apocalypse.

463
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,799
Is that necessary?

464
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,319
Can such bitterness and hatred fight against the three-body problem?

465
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,759
Until then.

466
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,119
Live happily.

467
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,879
Live on your own terms.

468
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,879
You have a responsibility for yourself.

469
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,999
Your favorite renaissance.

470
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,199
The ones with..

471
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,199
Human Spirit.

472
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,159
It's the same

473
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,359
Doesn't art show us

474
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,119
To look for joy and happiness?

475
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,239
I think

476
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,279
your plan

477
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,919
and my job

478
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,999
are nonexistent.

479
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,279
All this time I've been convincing myself

480
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,919
trying to believe

481
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,279
that it's all true.

482
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,439
To believe that you are useful.

483
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,879
But not until that moment

484
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,799
did I realize.

485
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,239
Of course, why are you useless?

486
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,479
please listen to me. 

487
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,719
I'm serious.

488
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,239
I want to ask you.

489
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,479
Who are you?

490
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,759
Do you really need me?

491
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,879
Of course I need you. 

492
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,079
Didn't I say that

493
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,439
you are most important. 

494
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,239
If..

495
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,999
if you're just an ordinary person.

496
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,359
You tell me

497
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,679
that I will be very happy.

498
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,799
But in fact

499
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,919
I'm not happy now. 

500
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,479
Or

501
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,759
I am as happy as I can be. 

502
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,639
Thank you Mr. Luo Ji. 

503
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,639
I will remember the starry sky tonight.

504
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,039
The pressure balance of the channel barometric chamber is completed.

505
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,679
Inner gate open.

506
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,439
Freight personnel are asked to enter the channel in an orderly manner with their badges.

507
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,919
Be careful in the future

508
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,959
of losing you badge. 

509
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,119
A replacement is not cheap.

510
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,839
Please note.

511
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,839
The K34 cargo cabin to the high-altitude transfer station will depart in advance.

512
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,319
Please prepare for boarding accordingly.

513
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,159
Thanks. 

514
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,679
Didn't you say you can't leave?

515
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,719
Forget it

516
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,039
that's for the spaceship.

517
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,119
You can only go if you have a license.

518
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,239
You.

519
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,279
Just put it here and slide it.

520
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,839
About to unleash ball lightning.

521
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,159
Relevant staff please do a good job in data analysis.

522
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,799
Ghost 1 is on track.

523
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,119
Arriving soon at the target area

524
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,999
The lightning state of the ball is stable.

525
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,359
Correct the relative position of the ball lightning and the target.

526
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,519
Calibration completed.

527
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,479
Confirm that the ball lightning is in the best attack position.

528
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,359
Ghost 1 is calculating the cloud map of the ball lightning position after two seconds.

529
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,319
Recycling program is automatically set.

530
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,519
Ball Lightning Unleashed.

531
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,719
Approaching target.

532
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,439
Destruction complete.

533
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,679
Ball lightning energy redundancy is higher than expected.

534
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,559
This kind of experiment has to be in space.

535
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,839
Good.

536
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,479
When will the electromagnetic launch rail be built?

537
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,359
You mean the massive ball lightning experiment?

538
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,479
Ask the PDC for more budget. 

539
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,919
Good.

540
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,479
Good.

541
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,359
Mr. Tyler.

542
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,439
I

543
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,559
am your wall breaker.
