1
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,119
Are you planning to create a

2
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,399
A space army armed with ball lightning

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,679
pity

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,199
no one alive inside

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,599
what have you done

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,879
did what you wanted

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,399
i lit the fire

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,799
but can't control it

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,519
the fire started to spread

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,959
i did what i could

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,199
It's your turn

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,959
PDC Issues Latest Notice on Ladder Accident

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,959
ten days ago

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,839
Tianlai high-altitude transfer station located in geosynchronous orbit

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,239
hit by accident

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,559
after the accident

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,319
PDC launches emergency response

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,839
do everything possible to treat the wounded

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,279
Carry out aftermath work

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,359
assessed

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,039
The impact damaged part of the structure of the ladder

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,319
but did not significantly affect the continued construction of the Spacedock

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,519
Ladder project has officially resumed

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,959
At the same time, PDC solemnly expresses

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,879
The process of human exploration of the universe is bound to be difficult

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,239
but we overcome

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,799
will never waver in our resolve to advance mainstream defense initiatives

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,079
In addition, the rumor that Taylor, the wallfacer, was broken into the wall has attracted the attention of all parties.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,839
The specific content of its plan has aroused heated debate among the public

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,839
PDC convenes urgent hearing and makes statement

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,519
The Wallface Project must not contain any content that harms human life

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,599
Therefore against Mr. Taylor

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,359
Newly built space elevator badly damaged

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,319
High-altitude transfer station structure torn

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,879
Spacedock over 90% destroyed

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,719
Massive debris causes 132 satellites to be scrapped

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,559
And within 5 years will be on the space station

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,119
Spacecraft and outer space activities pose a threat

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,959
Debris in progress

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,799
Overall progress of mainstream defense plans

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,079
delayed by about 18 months

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,919
in the accident

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,679
A total of 271 people died on the spot

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,119
272 people

45
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,999
272 people

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,039
Subsequent impact is still being counted

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,119
It is clear

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,079
This is a terrorist attack against the Wallface project

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
The ETO remnants codenamed "Von Neumann"

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,959
must take full responsibility for the accident

51
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,879
No

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,679
what he said is true

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,359
His fabricated remarks

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,799
All fellow human beings will not believe

55
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,319
In the name of the Wallfacers, we have

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,479
The families of the victims were properly accommodated

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,759
shortly after ladder

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,199
will also be fully repaired

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,639
the war has just begun

60
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,159
humans need you

61
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,279
mr taylor

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,119
my mission is over

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,479
president say

64
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,599
I have said in the hearing

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,839
I relieve Wallfacer from his duties

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,399
and apply

67
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,519
Make my statement available to the world

68
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,719
Can

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,079
mr taylor

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,039
have you heard the story of abraham

71
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,519
The part on Mount Moriah

72
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,719
We can only choose whether to sacrifice

73
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,119
but can't choose what to sacrifice

74
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,759
This is what you've been looking for

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,679
mr taylor

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,239
How do you respond to the wallbreaker's statement

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,159
Did you deliberately design the failure of the two experiments?

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,239
Is it to deceive Tomoko?

79
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,079
Is being broken part of your plan?

80
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
Do you feel like you successfully cheated the ETO?

81
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,719
What do you expect ETO to do next?

82
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,159
Do you think there will be new wallbreakers?

83
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,839
Can you publicly refute the Wall Breakers statement?

84
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,599
What do you want to say to the ETO remnants

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,719
Is Wallbreaker von Neumann still alive?

86
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,479
After meeting the Wallbreaker for the first time

87
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,479
What experience do you share with other Wallfacers

88
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,679
we believe in wallfacer taylor

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,399
mr taylor

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,239
Where will you choose your next experimental site

91
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,239
what is your next plan

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,359
The catastrophic loss caused by the failure of this space experiment

93
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,679
Is your Dr. Elena responsible?

94
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,519
Brother Luo

95
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,879
someone looking for

96
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,879
who

97
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,719
then wait for me soon

98
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,799
you go first

99
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,679
I just went to my room to tidy up

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,879
alarm

101
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,399
The base system is paralyzed

102
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,799
Ball lightning recovery procedure tampered with

103
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,479
Please troubleshoot immediately

104
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,039
spectrum

105
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,039
What is this

106
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,319
It's so beautiful here

107
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,199
like heaven

108
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,159
yes

109
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,959
that's all i have

110
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,439
terribly sorry

111
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,879
we're fine

112
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,279
the past

113
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,279
don't mention it

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,399
you are a smart man

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,039
even from a certain point of view

116
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,159
Additional load released

117
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,479
You are the most responsible person

118
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,079
Limit speed increased by 63.16%

119
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,399
I

120
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,599
How can it be

121
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,919
At least

122
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,159
you never hurt

123
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,159
people who should be protected

124
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,559
you are right

125
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,199
i came to you

126
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,039
Because only we can understand each other's pain

127
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,479
that person

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,439
is it true

129
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,159
he guessed right

130
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,119
But it wasn't this that hit me the hardest

131
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,879
After the Wall Breaker appeared

132
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,039
Broken website made all my plans public

133
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,439
PDC is also preparing to sentence me for crimes against humanity

134
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,959
but they said

135
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,399
the evidence

136
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,759
target acceleration too high

137
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,399
may be part of my strategy

138
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,319
It is recommended to suspend the docking order

139
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,679
I am not charged

140
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,159
Everybody give me that smile

141
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,879
Butt fit 43%

142
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,559
declare the meeting closed

143
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,079
Unable to complete docking

144
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,479
i was completely devastated

145
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,479
I rushed out of the venue

146
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,159
yell at people in the square

147
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,879
i'm wallfacer tyler

148
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,639
my wall breaker

149
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,919
Successfully debunked
my strategic fit 57%

150
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,319
he is right

151
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,999
Butt fit 72%

152
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,959
I'm going to use ball lightning

153
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,879
to attack the earth fleet

154
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,919
I want them to fight as quantum ghosts

155
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,679
Butt fit 93%

156
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,759
I'm going to kill, I'm against humanity

157
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,359
Butt fit 100%

158
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,919
kill me, punish me

159
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,999
Docking completed

160
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,799
The results of it

161
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,039
A large group of people gathered around me in the square to watch

162
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,679
Their eyes seem to say

163
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,879
look

164
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,439
he is wallfacer

165
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,599
cabin damage

166
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,359
he is working

167
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,159
Please fix it ASAP

168
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,159
how well he did

169
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,879
how much you pretend

170
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,439
Breaker

171
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,239
How can we see through his real purpose?

172
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
Restart to complete the restoration of some system modules

173
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,319
Send a message to the flight control center

174
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,919
No, the communication module is still loading

175
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,119
Progress seems to be stuck

176
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,159
you laughed too

177
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,759
The smile of the person facing the wall

178
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,399
A Wallfacer laughs at another Wallfacer

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,959
You also think I'm working

180
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,559
in disguise

181
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,439
Still executing the plan, right?

182
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,599
How did we get put in such a ridiculous situation

183
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,039
mr taylor

184
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,119
this

185
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,679
I'm afraid it's a vicious circle that we'll never get out of.

186
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,679
I tried

187
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,719
never get out

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,679
No

189
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,359
There is a way

190
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,599
I'm here to tell you how

191
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,199
You need rest

192
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,559
rest here for a few days

193
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,199

Are you OK

202
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,119
No way

203

staff please note

204
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,639

offer my deepest condolences

212
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,599
The inspection of the E ring road is almost finished, no problem

213
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,279
Greetings to fellow human beings

214
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,199
Batch D3421 has been inspected, don't worry

215
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,119
From human history to the present

216
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,119
experienced countless catastrophes

217
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,519
We have survived plague and war

218
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,799
and in the ocean

219
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,599
deserts and plains

220
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,679
built an immortal civilization

221
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,719
This bumpy but glorious 3 million years

222
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,759
on a cosmic scale

223
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,799
Maybe just for a moment

224
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,239
but no race

225
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,919
any civilization

226
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,959
can for any reason

227
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,119
small and obliterate everything
we hold dear

228
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,679
so

229
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,159
at the moment we are going to discuss

230
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,639
not just survive

231
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,399
more dignity

232
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,479
The enemy is present

233
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,999
Wallface plan and mainstream defense plan cooperate with each other

234
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,959
alarm

235
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,999
Damaged solar cell wings

236
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,639
Take advantage of each

237
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,839
Insufficient power supply

238
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,199
This is a testament to the cohesion and vitality of human beings

239
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,879
Ladder track position deviation increased

240
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,319
now

241
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,279
The Wallfacer Project enters a period of submersion

242
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,199
alarm

243
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,199
Well No. 1 in Gaokong First Ring was hit

244
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,599
Under the counterattack of the ETO organization

245
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,639
The outer wall structure of cabin d is broken down

246
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,879
Human defenses are being eaten away

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,439
human belief

248
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,479
Accepting the challenge

249
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,159
The 1d compartment of the first ring was broken down

250
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,719
Gravity Port 2 has a flammable warehouse

251
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,319
But we are not afraid of the challenge

252
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,199
Call for emergency assistance on nearby ring roads

253
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,559
Because human beings live and die

254
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,919
It's not a mess

255
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,119
Central Axis Rail Station Emergency Lock

256
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,359
but an indestructible whole

257
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,199
All cabins are out of service

258
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,359
the darkest hour

259
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,199
The more we must gather the trust of all mankind

260
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,799
I firmly believe this time

261
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,599
Damage to the control center
of the human victory axis

262
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,039
Counterweight adjustment procedure aborted

263
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,599
Ask the second-level engineer to repair immediately

264
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,079
I'm chief dispatcher scott

265
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,879
I ask everyone in the ring to perform an emergency evacuation

266
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,159
The Wallfacer's Sleep is not the Wallfacer's Sleep

267
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,079
The first-level emergency response plan has been activated

268
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,359
All emergency shelters and escape pods are open

269
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,519

repeat

271
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,639

ring everyone

273
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,119

perform an emergency evacuation

275
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,879
If mainstream defense plans were humanity's shield

276
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,078
then wall plan

277
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,318
by our thinking

278
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,999
A sharp sword pointed at Trisolaran's throat

279
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,999
As the current chairman of the PDC

280
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,439
I will take the survival of mankind as the highest mission

281
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,479
at all costs

282
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,679

will lead you

284
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,759

285
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,999
Let the approaching invaders see

286
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,079
human beings may be small

287
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,639
but never give in

288
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,279
alarm

not bad

326
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,199
Is it right

327
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,319
but you don't want to know

328
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,999
Ladder

329
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,159
what happened

chairman

331
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,719
How is the damage?

332
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,319
Ball lightning breaks down the boundary between macro and micro

333
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,319
This is impossible

334
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,519
Innumerable possibilities superimposed

335
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,959
What emerges is entirely determined by probability

336
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,919
This issue

337
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,839

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,679
I can only say

342
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,239
Like Schrödinger's cat that is both alive and dead

343
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,399
Are we underestimating the complexity of disasters?

344
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,639
This is the true face of the universe

345
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,239
everything is uncertain

346
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,919
are filtered out

347
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,359
only see numbers

348
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,999
Coordinate System

349
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,559
so you're saying

350
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,119
The real disaster has just begun
