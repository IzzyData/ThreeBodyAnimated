1
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,159
I can't even protect myself.

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,119
how can I save all mankind?

3
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,919
That may be.

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,719
It's part of the plan.

5
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,279
A day with Shi Qiang

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,439
What do you want to do?

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,119
Right.

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,239
Mr. Luo Ji asked us to find

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,479
this exact place.

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,679
A dream. 

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,479
What's hidden in people's heads

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,719
It's quite a lot.

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,359
If I said..

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,999
I wanted you to look for someone.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,999
Can you do it?

16
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,559
what are you doing?

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,599
Waiting.

18
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,439
what are you waiting for?

19
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,399
It's useless.

20
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,359
This is the same.

21
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,999
After World War II

22
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,599
the form of spirit just disappeared from the army.

23
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,839
That's the traditional army

24
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,359
not space force.

25
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,759
Have you ever thought about how

26
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,759
Once you surrender and before you die.

27
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,639
How would Trisolarans treat human prisoners of war?

28
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,679
You are contradictory.

29
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,518
Mr. Tyler.

30
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,879
Yes?

31
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,239
You are skeptical about the outcome of the war.

32
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,159
I'm here to avoid losing the war.

33
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,959
and yet you are convinced that I can find

34
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,879
something that doesn't exist.

35
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,279
This is the only way I can help you.

36
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,879
Mr. Tyler

37
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,119
Humanity

38
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,799
Won't fail.

39
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,359
Hello Mr. Tyler

40
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,679
associate Director of the Wallfacer Project.

41
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,039
Bog Doyle.

42
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,639
What is the diameter of the macroelectron in the grounded state?

43
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,399
20 cm

44
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,079
Not enough.

45
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,719
No way that

46
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,039
it can only be excited by energy level.

47
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,199
What do you mean?

48
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,799
What is not enough?

49
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,279
This is the alternate abort procedure

50
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,159
Can restore the ball lightning to a low-level energy state

51
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,639
to ensure the safety of the experimental process.

52
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,439
Throw it out. 

53
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,959
Throw it out.

54
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,199
I want a weapon

55
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,159
and you talk to me about safety.

56
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,519
The safest thing to do is to do nothing

57
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,799
if there is a problem with the experiment.

58
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,759
Mr. Tyler.

59
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,879
I have to contact the PDC.  

60
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,799
This has nothing to do with you. 

61
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,239
Let's not talk about safety, ok?

62
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,799
Good.

63
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,159
when I stimulate the macroelectrons to

64
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,279
highest energy state

65
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,919
its waves cover the entire target area

66
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,639
Is it enough?

67
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,119
Isn't that how it should have been?

68
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,239
It is correct.

69
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,839
Wait.

70
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,039
Electrons are subatomic particles..

71
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,799
You have all operated at this level. 

72
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,519
Dr. Dingyi's microscopic lock.

73
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,439
Macroelectrons. 

74
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,159
Electrons on a macroscopic scale

75
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,279
that are visible to the naked eye

76
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,999
require special calibration tools.

77
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,199
That's why we came all the way here.

78
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,679
Compared to the naked eye

79
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,159
the optical detection system used in B3436 experiments

80
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,559
is needed to see them more clearly.

81
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,599
60 degrees southeast.

82
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,559
3mm

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,519
Done. 

84
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:02,959
Stop.

85
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,559
This is the Lethal Weapon's baby state.

86
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,239
It won't be any threat. 

87
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,679
Macroelectrons have been released.

88
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,319
Don't worry. 

89
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,119
Radiation detected.

90
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,719
Confirm that the macrolectron is in a stable state. 

91
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,199
Right now it's only an empty bubble.

92
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,319
and the diameter of the channel is 13.6 meters.

93
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,999
Verify levitation. 

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,039
Motion limited to a 67.9 cm radius.

95
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,479
But as far as I know

96
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,799
Ball lightning

97
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,679
can't be limited by physical barriers. 

98
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,559
how is it contained?

99
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,399
It has a certain amount of negative charge

100
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,839
and can only bound by one thing.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,079
A magnetic field. 

102
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,879
Of course I know that. 

103
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,839
That's fine. 

104
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,039
We tested the magnetic field strength

105
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,119
50,000 bionic dynamic magnets here

106
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,359
have full control over the speed of the ball lightning.

107
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,159
Acceleration zone magnetic traction test.

108
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,439
The same principle applies to space elevators.

109
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,599
Increment the magnetic force.

110
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,679
Applied voltage has reached 100 million volts.

111
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,039
The magnetic field has covered the target area.

112
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,599
Acknowledged.

113
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,159
What

114
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,159
This is too primitive. 

115
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,079
This is..

116
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,359
Obsidian.

117
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,799
This is just stone. 

118
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,599
You spent billions

119
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,319
The target

120
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,839
is designed according to the physical data model. 

121
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,719
It contains all known elements on earth

122
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,239
in a stable form to prevent reactions

123
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,479
and the inside

124
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,119
forms a polycrystalline structure

125
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,319
The wave front created in the instant of collision

126
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,798
will leave traces in the detection area. 

127
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,799
This is important data for building a model of the ball lightning weapon. 

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,839
If it were merely a rock

129
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,959
then we're just merely carbohydrates. 

130
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,999
Such an expensive experiment

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,159
what if it fails?

132
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,719
There is always a one in ten thousand possibility. 

133
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,519
Impossible. 

134
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,559
Any results are good results. 

135
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,079
What we want to see

136
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,119
That is, after hitting this collection of elements

137
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,159
what will happen?

138
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,759
During the moment of contact 

139
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,879
what if the elements react again?

140
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,679
They will not. 

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,159
Ball lightning is faster than them. 

142
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,239
But you just said

143
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,839
Macroelectrons is slow. 

144
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,199
Macroelectrons needs artificial lightning for excitation. 

145
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,719
Only then will it have all the attributes of a quantum state weapon. 

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,279
That can be called

147
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,759
ball lightning. 

148
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,439
The old equipment at the base of the B436 project

149
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,959
has been restored

150
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,599
but it still requires you to provide the key for the core components. 

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,839
Leave it alone

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,319
Let us head into the laboratory.

153
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,599
Have you checked the parameters of the high-speed camera?

154
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,399
No problems. 

155
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,599
Enough to slow down the experiment process by a factor of 1.5 million. 

156
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,919
Mr. Tyler. 

157
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,679
Doctor. 

158
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,999
Surveillance system checked. 

158
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:58,200
Ok.

159
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,839
Mr. Tyler. 

160
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,719
Please follow me. 

161
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,479
The test data is stable. 

162
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,919
The Experiment is ready to begin. 

163
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,959
Begin recording. 

164
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,319
7:00 a.m.

165
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,559
Instrument calibration complete. 

166
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,959
Please confirm. 

167
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,079
Who is speaking?

168
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,879
Voiceprint confirmed. 

169
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,639
The excitation area is ready to start. 

170
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,799
It is the previous experiment leader

171
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,519
but don't know who. 

172
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,719
That person

173
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,919
Where are they now?

174
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,479
Please begin. 

175
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,759
Macroelectrons process initiated. 

176
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,879
Macroelectrons storage state is stable. 

177
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,199
Location set.  

178
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,679
Superconducting terminal battery is negative. 

179
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,639
The superconducting wire is connected

180
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,919
Ready. 

181
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,239
Start the macroelectrons process. 

182
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,039
Macroelectrons and the electromagnetic rail are ready.

183
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,079
Lightning ready. 

184
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,839
Ready.

185
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,639
300 kA

186
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,879
600 kA

187
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,719
800 kA

187
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,300
Ball lighthning excitation completed.

188
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,679
The precession path is stable. 

189
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,159
The ball lightning has jumped to a high energy state.

190
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,759
Success.

191
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,759
Don't relax yet.

192
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,359
Correct the magnetic field strength in the target area. 

193
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,839
Sorry doctor. 

194
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,519
What happened?

195
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,719
Was there a power outage?

196
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,719
or a device failure?

197
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,679
Doctor. 

198
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,359
The energy value of the target area has returned to normal. 

199
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,799
Restart the monitoring system.

200
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,439
Doctor. 

201
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,399
I don't know how..

202
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,479
I cleaned the target area. 

203
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,519
Don't speak. 

204
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,519
It's useless. 

205
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,599
It's all over now. 

206
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,479
Are the experiment results still valid?

207
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,319
Polluted. 

208
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,039
I'm sorry. 

209
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,199
Give me another 7 days. 

210
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,719
please. 

211
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,039
It's useless to give you another 7 years

212
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,679
if you don't have the capability. 

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,759
An utter waste. 

214
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,239
You are

215
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,999
only holding me back. 

216
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,159
Uh.. 

217
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,639
Mr. Tyler applied for

218
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,039
the next space experiment budget. 

219
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,199
just do as he says. 

229
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,199
OMEN Shadow Elf 8 Pro

233
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,439
Please sit. 

234
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,319
Hello

235
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,239
My name is Luo Ji. 

236
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,719
Mr. Luo Ji, The water pipe broke. 

237
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,799
The decoration team can't come. 

238
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,839
We must make a satellite phone call to the PDC now. 

239
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,479
OK, OK, you can figure it out. 

240
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,239
Don't call me if the water pipe breaks.

241
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,399
It doesn't concern me. 

242
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,279
Hello. 

243
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,119
Excuse me. 

244
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,319
You are..

245
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,319
Is it Mr. Luo?

246
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,399
She's talking to you.

247
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,319
I am Luo Ji.

248
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,999
Hello.

249
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,039
You two talk. 

250
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,319
I'll go check it out. 

251
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,959
Hello Mr. Luo. 

252
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,599
My name is Yan

253
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,599
Professor Luo? 

254
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,679
Miss Yan.

255
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,239
Hello.

256
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,799
Sit, please sit. 

257
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,199
My name is Zhuang. 

258
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,039
Professor Luo

259
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,159
Just call me Zhuang Yan

260
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,759
Zhuang Yan. 

261
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,599
Sorry. 

262
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,439
I am sorry.

263
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,759
Have some tea. 

264
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,439
Thank you. 

265
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,439
Oh, right. 

266
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,679
I almost forgot. 

267
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,879
Are you cold

268
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,959
perhaps?

269
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,959
I'll light the fireplace right away. 

270
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,359
I thought

271
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,119
you would be very fierce

272
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,359
every moment

273
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,959
and throw things like this

274
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,439
No no no..

275
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,159
no.

276
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,879
You misunderstand. 

277
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,439
I was..

278
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,399
I know.

279
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,119
This is sudden. 

280
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,519
Right. 

281
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,199
A bit sudden. 

282
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,359
Oh, right. 

283
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,679
Say..

284
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,759
What did you..

285
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,279
think I would look like?

286
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,719
It's nothing.

287
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,399
Say whatever you think.

288
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,359
I thought you would

289
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,879
stand in front a map every day

290
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,399
and point at a bunch of people in uniform.

291
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,039
Come on..

292
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,279
I'm not like that.

293
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,599
Then I thought about

294
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,039
what kind of work you might arrange for me.

295
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,559
Work.

296
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,959
Oh, right. 

297
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,119
You are a student. 

298
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,319
learning to draw.

299
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,119
Right?

300
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,239
The last cohort of students of the Qingyun Academy of Fine Arts

301
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,199
Last cohort?

302
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,679
The professor said..

303
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,399
painting in this era

304
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,039
is useless.

305
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,399
Professor Luo

306
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,839
What do you think?

307
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,399
How could that be possible? Zhuang Yan.

308
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,039
What you need to know is 

309
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,479
that in this era especially

310
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,839
there should be something that nourishes the heart.

311
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,679
Did you know

312
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,279
Goethe said

313
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,159
that his beloved..

314
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,479
What kind of bird language?

315
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,359
Is it an angle grinder or a vertical drill?

316
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,039
Can you straighten your tongue?

317
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,319
You!

318
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,319
About what Goethe said..

319
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,639
At that time he said

320
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,839
why are you yelling?

321
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,879
I know where to find you. 

322
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,919
The Excavator is here.

323
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,319
I will dig up the graves for eight generations of your ancestors.

324
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,199
Jerk. 

325
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,159
Really..

326
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,439
I'm furious.

327
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,479
What did you say

328
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,399
Mr. Luo Ji?

329
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,479
Jeez. 

330
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,399
Wait for me

331
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,719
I'll drive the excavator

332
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,159
right over the top of your head.

333
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,559
They are fixing the plumbing. 

334
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,759
What did the PDC say?

335
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,519
Professor Luo

336
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,519
are you ok?

337
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,679
I'm ok. 

338
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,239
Would you like some red wine?

339
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,919
Sure..

340
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,159
Only us.

341
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,799
where were we?

342
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,639
Goethe.

343
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,439
Right.

344
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,119
Yes. 

345
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,839
You can escape from this world

346
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,359
through art

347
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,279
in a more reliable way.

348
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,119
That..

349
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,639
is the allure of art.

350
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,599
Say..

351
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,199
Can I continue to draw?

352
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,319
Of course you can.

353
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,239
Zhuang Yan.

354
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,239
Believe me.

355
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,439
No matter how the world changes. 

356
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,279
In here

357
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,679
art and beauty

358
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,799
come first.

359
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,199
So in here

360
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,359
you..

361
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,279
come first. 

362
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,279
Brother Luo, I think..

363
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,559
you guys should go outside and talk.

364
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,279
The house is falling down.

365
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,679
Professor Luo

366
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,159
do you have something to say?

367
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,239
Nothing.

368
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,879
I just want to ask you.

369
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,239
Do you like it here?

370
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,759
But don't answer now. 

371
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,439
I love it. 

372
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,759
Really?

373
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,599
Look.

374
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,559
It looks like

375
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,679
the eyes of sunset.

376
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,719
The sky here is different from anywhere else

377
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,759
it's very open.

378
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,799
I feel that too

379
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,479
like in

380
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,359
the north pole. 

381
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,879
or..

382
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,599
don't say.

383
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,239
I do not want to know.

384
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,679
Why?

385
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,599
As soon as I know where I am

386
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,599
the world seems smaller.

387
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,319
I see. 

388
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,679
Actually

389
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,559
I do not know either.

390
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,519
really?

391
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,839
except now you are here

392
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,799
I do not want to know anything. 

393
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,159
Brother Luo.

394
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,199
Dinner.

395
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,239
I'm coming.

396
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,719
How have you been feeling recently?

397
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,479
I did what you said

398
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,639
But it's getting worse.

399
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,279
You say love

400
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,279
but..

401
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,039
This is serious.

402
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,439
What else?

403
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,279
Or

404
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,799
how you feel..

405
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,479
What made you feel this strongly?

406
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,119
One day

407
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,919
I saw her in the library

408
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,759
and she

409
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,439
smiled at me a little.

410
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,599
You mean

411
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,119
she is real?

412
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,679
Yes.

413
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,719
No.

414
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,599
You could say

415
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,959
she is more than real. 

416
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,399
Please relax.

417
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,199
It's ok if you don't want to say. 

418
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,199
I do not know what to say.

419
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,999
For example

420
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,279
in your novel.

421
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,919
How did you imagine her when you wrote it?

422
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,639
why do you think

423
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,479
you developed feelings for her?

424
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,799
what are your thoughts?

425
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,359
Go ahead. 

426
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,599
I used to think

427
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,359
The characters in a novel are controlled by the author.

427
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,359
But that's not true. 

427
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,359
It's almost the opposite. 

428
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,399
I can feel her presence. 

428
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,200
I can feel it all around me.

429
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,079
I can feel it bit by bit 

430
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,759
and see the outline of her life.

431
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,279
I imagine a rainy day

432
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,679
everyone is in a hurry.

433
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,599
But then I see.

434
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,039
She takes a leisurely walk in the rain.

435
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,359
She suddenly puts away the umbrella.
.
437
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:34,879
She Enjoys the feeling of twirling in the rain.

438
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,639
She Enjoys the feeling of being in contact with the rain.

439
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,079
I also imagined her closet.

440
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,399
The color and style of each garment.

441
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,879
her song preference.

442
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,319
the movies she likes.

443
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,399.
and what's on her dresser.

444
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,359
and how she doesn't need makeup.

447
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,759
The way she was born is best.

448
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,719
most beautiful.

449
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,879
and sometimes

451
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,159
She is there

452
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,319
sitting in the clasroom.

453
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,199
Wearing a beige turtleneck sweater

454
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,719
she smiles at me.

455
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,679
It's like..

456
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,159
like the sun rising after a snowstorm. 

458
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,239
Oh..

459
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,279
I can't go on like this. 

460
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,719
How can you give all your feelings to a ghost?

461
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,399
How can I?

462
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,359
Please be serious. 

463
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,919
This is serious.

464
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,359
I am in love with a

465
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,679
person who doesn't exist.

466
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,559
a fantasy and yet,

467
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,399
I live with her.

468
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,159
You also said

469
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,599
Just because she doesn't like the smell of cigarettes.

470
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,359
I don't know what to do. 

471
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,999
as long as

472
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,039
she is there for me

473
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,319
I feel very happy too.

474
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,719
I am satisfied.

475
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,599
I know everything is fake

476
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,359
I can never touch her

477
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,519
but i will never forget her.

478
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,319
Don't forget

478
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,000
about why you are here. 

479
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,879
is this ok?

480
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,919
Just don't resist the people around you

481
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,519
let nature take its course.

482
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,559
Her influence on you will become less and less

484
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,079
actually you can think of it this way

485
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,439
Whether she really exists or not

486
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,199
your love

486
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,599
is real to you.
