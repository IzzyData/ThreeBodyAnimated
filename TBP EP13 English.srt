2
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,959
The frequency spectrum of the ball lightning now matches the human body precisely.

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,559
This is a masterpiece specially created for you.

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,559
The signal near the high-altitude station disappeared instantly.

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,159
Above.

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,919
It's like suddenly adding a transparent cover.

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,839
The ball lightning pierced the boundaries between macro and micro,

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,199
and the quantum body it formed.

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,239
Like mold,

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,159
it infected the macro world we are in.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,719
Once it begins to expand,

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,159
The entire space will produce mutations that we do not understand

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,879
and cannot control.

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,879
I pressed it.

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,199
I listened to you.

16
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,039
Alert.

17
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,439
The ball lightning recovery program is interrupted.

18
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,879
Please check immediately.

19
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,199
Alert.

20
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,599
The ball lightning recovery program is interrupted.

21
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,999
Please check immediately.

22
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,559
As the first person to break a wallfacer,

23
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,879
you are worthy of admiration.

24
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,199
Von Neumann.

25
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,759
Our lord

26
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,399
will be with you forever.

27
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,959
He faced only

28
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,759
a poor strategist.

29
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,239
An unqualified wallfacer.

30
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,159
You envy him.

31
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,159
Rey Diaz's hibernation application

32
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,359
has been approved.

33
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,199
The same goes for Hines.

34
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,559
It seems that in a regular life

35
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,399
we can complete our mission.

36
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,079
But do you want to know

37
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,079
What is happening on

38
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,879
the Ladder now?

39
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,879
Tyler has been broken,

40
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,239
but Luo Ji is still there.

41
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,919
I only know

42
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,359
what the lord needs me to know.

43
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,399
Don't forget

44
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,119
Luo Ji confronts the Lord directly

45
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,599
and

46
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,279
whether it is ETO

47
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,039
or ordinary humans

48
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,679
the lord's blockade of the sub-atomic

49
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,799
is complete.

50
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,199
Just checked one and panicked.

51
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,039
The door that can directly leave the cabin is broken

52
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,159
and this window is made of aerospace glass

53
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,599
which didn't even break from high-speed debris.

54
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,039
We definitely can't smash it open,

55
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,439
And even if we go out,

56
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,119
how to return to the ground is also a problem.

57
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,799
Fortunately, there are still supplies left.

58
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,759
Do you think

59
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,279
the PDC knows we're still alive?

60
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,799
Hard to say.

61
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,399
I've always wanted to ask.

62
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,079
Do you really have the ability to defeat aliens?

63
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,479
Well

64
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,879
Look here.

65
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,839
I just need to snap my fingers

66
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,439
and the solar system

67
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,839
will disappear.

68
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,919
You really believe that?

69
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,519
I'm kidding you.

70
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,479
There are no superheroes in this world.

71
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,039
Wallfacers.

72
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,359
Aren't they?

73
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,679
If only that were true.

74
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,759
Do I look like a superhero now?

75
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,039
What's going on? Why hasn't the Chairman arrived yet?

76
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,799
The Ladder is the core of human near-earth defense works.

77
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,759
What's happening now?

78
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,799
It is said that only one cabin has been destroyed.

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,759
Not sure.

80
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,399
The flight control center is not releasing any information.

81
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,759
It must be related to the wallbreaker.

82
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,839
What about the rescue plan?

83
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
Why isn't she bringing it to a vote?

84
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,279
It is said that the wallfacer Luo Ji is up there.

85
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,079
Really?

86
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,279
That's troublesome.

87
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,159
Contact Ronan.

88
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,919
Ask how long the chairman will take.

89
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,719
No need.

90
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,559
I'll attend the meeting on behalf of the chairman.

91
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,159
No one can replace her.

92
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,959
That's right.

93
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,559
So the chairman must command the rescue effort with all her might.

94
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,399
For other matters

95
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,799
she has authorized me.

96
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,319
The only way is to give up the Ladder.

97
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,159
Why?

98
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,919
Images from the low-altitude station show that there

99
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,919
are now two symmetrical quantum bodies near the high-altitude station.

100
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,239
It should be what Dr. Ding said.

101
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,679
The symmetrical energy range formed

102
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,239
with the macro atomic nucleus as the center.

103
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,599
The human understanding of the sub-atomic is too limited.

104
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,159
The only thing we can do is

105
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,999
to keep it away from us.

106
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,919
You see.

107
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,119
The top weight station is also a nuclear power plant.

108
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,559
As long as the maximum magnetic force is turned on,

109
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,199
The quantum body will be attracted

110
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,199
and as it floats towards the Yellow River Station..

111
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,399
It will be attracted.

112
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,399
Are you sure?

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,919
Yes.

114
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,319
I can't say anything else,

115
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,159
but I found that

116
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,879
the properties of the macro electron

117
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,079
have been preserved 

118
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,639
so these original properties

119
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,239
can be fully utilized

120
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,959
such as

121
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,079
magnetic confinement.

122
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,119
Have you verified it?

123
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,199
theoretically, right?

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,279
In Dr. Elena's final message. 

125
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,279
I found the energy level data of the ball lightning.

126
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,319
After inputting it into the calculated quantum body model

127
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,359
it unexpectedly worked. 

128
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,439
What does this mean?

129
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,239
DNA.

130
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,839
Like human DNA

131
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,439
some things are unchangeable.

132
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,519
Ball lightning can be confined by a magnetic field

133
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,519
and the quantum body should be able to as well.

134
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,839
This means

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,798
that starting the nuclear power plant at the top of the ladder

136
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,119
is like creating a predictable

137
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,918
path for the quantum body.

138
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,799
Eventually, the Yellow River Station will split in two

139
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,639
and the detached part

140
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,999
will be carried into deep space with the quantum body.

141
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,639
Also, the fluctuations of the macro gravity particles are not continuous.

142
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,079
Once the gravity towards humans weakens

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,239
the survivors have a good chance of being rescued.

144
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,239
Can the auxiliary nuclear power plant handle the power?

145
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,679
The risk assessment table data is not good. 

146
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,319
It's about right.

147
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,839
All departments have done their best

148
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,559
and the verification data has been submitted.

149
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,759
This is all we can do now.

150
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,799
But we cannot get through the fiber optic cable to go up

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,559
and all wireless signals are lost.

152
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,679
The only control panel that can send instructions to the Yellow River Station

153
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,159
is the one in the high-altitude station.

154
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,439
Our spacecraft cannot enter

155
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,719
and we cannot contact the survivors.

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,999
We are just waiting to die.

157
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,239
This is

158
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,639
so bizarre.

159
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,239
We need to come up with a solution.

160
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,319
Don't keep us in suspense. 

161
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,959
Speak up.

162
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,199
I have a way

163
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,079
to find someone.

164
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,039
Dr. Ding

165
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,359
Can you see what is up there?

166
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,159
Then it must not be completely blocked by the light.

167
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,479
Strictly speaking,

168
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,599
only a portion of visible light

169
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,439
can penetrate all electromagnetic waves. 

170
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,079
Alright.

171
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,959
Do you have something that can emit light.

172
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,559
Like a long-range reflective object?

173
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,839
Does this count? 

174
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,599
Solar panels?

175
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,359
That will work.

176
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,079
Chairman,

177
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,479
have you heard of a beacon tower?

178
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,599
Sure, Da Shi,

179
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,759
but the way to communicate with the quantum body

180
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,319
has really stumped you.

181
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,439
The 16th transmission

182
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,039
has selected the No. 5 sail panel array,

183
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,959
with a positive azimuth adjustment of 27 arc seconds

184
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,679
and a negative elevation adjustment of 14 arc seconds.

185
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,679
The parameters have been entered,

186
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,039
and the target has been focused

187
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,519
on the first ring of the high-altitude station.

188
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,559
Received.

189
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,239
Backup power key for the high-altitude station

190
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,759
has been sent for the 46th time.

191
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,719
The relative angle of the solar panel has begun to be adjusted

192
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,999
to focus on the sunlight.

193
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,799
What is the transmission distance?

194
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,519
Focal length of 16,000 kilometers,

195
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,079
with a deviation of less than 50 meters

196
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,959
to ensure that the C-ring road in the first ring can see it.

197
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,959
There are probably only a few people left breathing among the survivors.

198
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,599
No problem.

199
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,519
Even with slight scattering on the light path,

200
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,799
the light intensity is sufficient.

201
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,919
I just don't know how many survivors

202
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,239
in there can understand Morse code.

203
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,519
Sometimes

204
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,839
I wonder 

205
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,919
if it's hard for you

206
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,679
to be a wallfacer

207
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,519
for so long. 

208
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,199
Yeah.

209
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,719
I wish it was easier.

210
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,159
That's how it is. 

211
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,039
When Michelangelo painted "Genesis" 

212
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,079
there was a worker who

213
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,639
passed him brushes.

214
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,239
It took over four years,

215
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,799
but he said it was his most meaningful work

216
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,559
because he could never paint "Genesis" himself.

217
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,439
If he could give a little help to the painter,

218
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,519
he would feel valuable too. 

219
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,159
That's how I felt after meeting you.

220
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,639
You compared me to Michelangelo.

221
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,279
Do you know how great he was?

222
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,439
Yes.

223
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,759
I studied art history.

224
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,119
I shouldn't have brought you up here.

225
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,919
If we never got stuck here.

226
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,719
I wouldn't have known how beautiful the Earth is.

227
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,519
If this is the last scene we see..

228
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,559
It's not bad..

229
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,559
Right?

230
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,319
Luo Ji?

231
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,639
Quick

232
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,559
Do you have pen and paper?

233
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,359
Give it to me quickly.

234
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,639
Here. 

235
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,159
Oh my God

236
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,679
What

237
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,759
is this?

238
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,239
Chairman

239
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,039
can't we try something else?

240
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,599
Give them some time

241
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,039
wait a bit longer.

242
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,119
Short, short, long.

243
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,159
Emergency power supply system has been activated.

244
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,359
The high-altitude lighting subsystem has temporarily resumed.

245
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,919
Quick, look!

246
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,119
Is there light?

247
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,519
Pass it down, pass it down.

248
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,239
Hurry up!

249
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,759
The image is coming through.

250
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,319
There's a light source at the high-altitude station.

251
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,719
That's great.

252
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,079
I guessed it right. 

253
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,959
It's Morse code.

254
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,999
We are saved.

255
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,279
Someone is looking for us.

256
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,319
We are safe.

257
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,679
That's great, wonderful.

258
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,439
Ding Yi, did something happen?

259
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,839
I'm afraid there's no time to celebrate.

260
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,999
Not to dampen everyone's spirits.

261
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,799
The data shows that the expansion of the quantum state

262
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,559
will accelerate after a certain point. 

263
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,599
There's only about 8 hours left before the Ladder

264
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,759
completely covered.

265
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,399
What do you mean?

266
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,839
Does it mean that all the survivors on the Ladder

267
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,359
including those in the low-altitude station

268
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,679
will all die?

269
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,279
Yes.

270
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,559
Chairman. 

271
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,879
The survival area is about to enter the illuminated area.

272
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,879
Quick, Shi Qiang.

273
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,439
Convey this information to the survivors.

274
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,159
Understood.

275
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,319
Don't you all want to know the complete rescue plan?

276
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,119
The survivors should be in the C1 emergency shelter

277
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,039
so they can activate the backup power supply.

278
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,399
But it's too close to the quantum body

279
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,239
they have to move to the outer ring compartment

280
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,039
to the

281
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,679
No.2 gravity port

282
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,319
and then return to the central axis.

283
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,679
We used it when we came up

284
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,599
but the No.2 gravity port has been destroyed.

285
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,039
Even if they have to walk outside the cabin,

286
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,359
the surroundings are all blocked.

287
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
The next operation requires a lot of energy.

288
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,279
So they need to find the N48 supply station along the central axis.

289
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,719
That's a safer option.

290
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,199
During the process the quantum body will move upward.

291
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,719
Make sure it will not move to this location

292
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,599
and this position

293
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,479
is the least damaged.

294
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,239
But the outside of the cabin is too dangerous.

295
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,119
The compartment is broken like this.

296
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,879
So it's safer to wear a space suit outside the cabin.

297
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,039
I have calculated

298
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,719
that once the quantum body starts to move upward,

299
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,479
the N48 supply station will for certain be a safe location.

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,479
After they complete the operation

301
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,719
they have to return to this location

302
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,359
to wait for our rescue.

303
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,199
Any precautions?

304
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,479
The space suit is fully intelligent.

305
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,959
Everything is done according to the UI operation

306
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,199
except for one thing.

307
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,679
Don't enable the visual enhancement mode.

308
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,639
What is it?

309
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,439
Can you understand it?

310
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,719
I'm a second-level engineer.

311
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,599
What do you think?

312
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,519
It's a function developed during the construction of the ladder

313
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,399
which can reconstruct the environmental data around it.

314
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,679
But ordinary people who have not been trained

315
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,559
will instead affect their normal vision.

316
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,559
In any case

317
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,279
let's do our best

318
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,559
and leave the rest to fate.

319
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,599
They said that this quantum state thing

320
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,079
will soon cover this place.

321
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,279
What should we do?

322
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,679
Since Engineer Yang

323
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,799
can understands it

324
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,15
he should also know Morse code.

325
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,799
Ask him to use flashing light to identify himself.

326
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,559
In case of any accidents

327
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,919
in the last moments

328
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,719
humanity will remember his contributions.

329
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,519
Chairman.

330
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,479
What's the matter?

331
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,319
What did he say?

332
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,559
It's Luo Ji.

333
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,439
The wallfacer.

334
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,119
It turned out to be him.

335
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,159
What a coincidence.

336
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,199
Now we are sure.

337
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,879
That's great, Chairman.

338
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,039
Stop the operation.

339
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,239
Warning: the ladder's gravity system is about to fail.

340
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,759
What happened?

341
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,439
I don't know.

342
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
Maybe the central axis has a problem.

343
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,439
Your notes.

344
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,079
Forget it.

345
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,079
The direction is changing.

346
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,879
Hold on to me.

347
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,039
Okay.

348
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,519
Be careful.

349
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,279
Why are we standing on the wall

350
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,919
while everything else is floating?

351
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,359
Is it a gravity broken?

352
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,879
No.

353
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,479
I'm afraid the quantum body is getting closer.

354
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,519
Quickly

355
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,759
let's go to the operating platform.

356
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,559
We have to contact PDC.

357
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,879
Chairman

358
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,639
there's no other way.

359
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,199
I think

360
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,359
the Chairman is following the Wallfacer Act.

361
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,559
But which article in the act

362
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,679
allows us to let the wallfacer take such risks?

363
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,159
Before he receives assistance

364
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,639
he should wait for PDC's rescue at the safe point.

365
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,919
Chairman

366
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,839
even if we can find another survivor

367
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,759
it's too late.

368
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,279
Only when the nuclear power plant

369
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,159
is started is there any safety

370
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,359
and without it

371
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,759
the rescue plan cannot be completed.

372
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,159
However, the lives of the Wallfacers are threatened.

373
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,799
which is the fault of the PDC.

374
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,519
We cannot bear this responsibility.

375
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,879
Chairman.

376
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,159
At this point

377
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,999
why not let the spacecraft in again?

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,919
Engineer Yang,

379
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,079
Ding Yi,

380
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,519
I will be out for a few minutes.

381
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,959
You cannot do this now.

382
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,159
PDC Chairman.

383
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,119
You cannot let the Wallfacers be in danger.

384
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,279
But you can establish a temporary staff headquarters for Luo Ji.

385
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,799
I will take responsibility

386
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,159
for any consequences.

387
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,559
Do you understand?

388
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,759
Quickly

389
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,359
is there anything else that hasn't been told to the Wallfacers?

390
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,159
Upload it.

391
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,799
Ding Yi

392
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,879
we're ready here.

393
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,679
Hurry.

394
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,319
Good.

395
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,279
The current situation is more complicated than before.

396
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,319
The quantum body has expanded to a certain extent

397
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,439
and the gravitational disturbance it produces is constantly increasing.

398
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,719
In theory, the most reliable way for them to escape

399
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,079
using the observer effect is to be inside the quantum body.

400
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,879
But Luo Ji cannot establish stable

401
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,279
communication outside the shielding layer now.

402
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,759
His only escape tool now is the space suit. 

403
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,919
However, relying solely on this

404
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,919
it is impossible to escape the gravitational range in general.

405
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,919
Then what about in specific circumstances?

406
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,719
Speak plainly.

407
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,879
It's like crashing into a high-speed carousel.

408
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,799
The Wallfacers must jump into the gravity net first

409
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,359
in order to exchange angular momentum

410
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,599
in the elastic collision.

411
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,439
I get it.

412
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,879
Treat it as a gravity booster

413
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,479
and gain acceleration while turning.

414
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,159
Yes.

415
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,239
Similar to the gravity slingshot effect.

416
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,199
Do we have to head towards the quantum body?

417
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,719
Why don't we just go straight out of the cabin?

418
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,319
We can't escape the gravity directly.

419
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,959
We have to borrow force to be thrown out.

420
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,159
No.

421
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,479
The quantum body is too dangerous.

422
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,559
Even running won't be fast enough.

423
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,839
How can we jump into it?

424
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,639
This is the only way out.

425
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,239
The probability density outside the conscious layer is relatively low.

426
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,839
As long as Luo Ji passes through from there

427
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,599
and if the speed is fast enough

428
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,239
the influence of the quantum body can be minimized to the greatest extent.

429
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,359
Jet flow vector angle 31 degrees.

430
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,079
Jet flow rate 400 per second.

431
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,119
I've calculated the parameters for the jump.

432
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,319
The parameters for the thrusters are set.

433
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,399
Should I put it on now?

434
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,719
Ask them to wear their helmets and use the intercom.

435
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,479
Luo Ji calls Miss Yan.

436
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,159
OVER. (End)

437
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,439
Miss Yan receiving.

438
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,319
OVER. (End)

439
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,679
There will be

440
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,919
electromagnetic interference at that time, won't there?

441
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,079
If they gets too close to the quantum body

442
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,439
this effect will occur.

443
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,479
There's a noise. 

444
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,119
I know, that means it's

445
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,679
working better than any alarm.

446
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,159
There are a lot of tricks.

447
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,399
The cabin depressurization will be completed soon.

448
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,719
Please confirm that the preparations are complete

449
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,439
and you are ready to leave the cabin.

450
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,799
Before departure

451
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,319
you must use the emergency control panel

452
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,799
to open all the main doors of the cabin.

453
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,599
Only in this way

454
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,399
can they be given the safest 

455
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,959
path possible for flight.

456
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,199
Tell him

457
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,519
no matter what subverts common sense

458
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,599
don't panic

459
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,519
and move quickly.

460
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,439
You're not as cynical as they say

461
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,279
you are, and in fact, just the opposite.

462
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,319
You've only met a few people.

463
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,399
Really.

464
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,559
Uncle Shi said the same thing.

465
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,639
Before

466
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,439
It was because I didn't care about anything

467
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,239
and didn't take anything seriously.

468
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,039
What about now?

469
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,439
Because..

470
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,959
I care too much.

471
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,679
We

472
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,879
have succeeded.

473
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,999
Almost.

474
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,199
It should be soon.

475
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,879
Grab me.

476
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,679
Quickly.

477
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,799
Detected spatial positioning anomaly.

478
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,279
System judges cross-compartmental external operation.

479
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,799
Visual enhancement mode has been automatically activated.

480
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,959
I got you. 

481
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,519
Wait for me.

482
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,759
Attitude stabilization mode has been enabled.

483
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,839
Luo Ji, are you ok?

484
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,119
Wake up quickly.

485
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,879
The super-heavy overload value has dropped to a safe range.

486
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,919
Luo Ji, wake up quickly.

487
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,079
Visual enhancement mode has been lifted.

488
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,679
Look.

489
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,719
They're still alive.

490
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,479
Luo Ji.

491
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,919
The quantum body seems to be getting closer.

492
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,839
You have to come back quickly.

493
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,479
I can't just leave it alone.

494
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,959
Otherwise, we'll both die here.

495
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,919
Do you hear me?
