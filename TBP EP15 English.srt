3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,839
They say this quantum state thing

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,039
will soon cover this place.

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,279
What should we do?

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,039
The only thing we can do is

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,399
to keep it away from us.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,039
Hurry

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,239
go to the control panel

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,759
and start up the nuclear power station at the top of the ladder.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,319
The quantum body will be attracted to it.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,439
We succeeded.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,559
Alert.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,839
Hydraulic brake system malfunction.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,559
The main structure of the high-altitude transfer station is about to be damaged.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,959
Alert. Oxygen remaining 65%.

17
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,919
Alert.

18
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,439
Air leak and depressurization detected in extravehicular spacesuit.

19
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,599
Please take immediate safety measures.

20
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,559
Alert.

21
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,519
Oxygen remaining 55%.

22
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,359
Alert.

23
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,679
Oxygen remaining 48%.

24
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,279
This should be it.

25
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,519
Ding Yi

26
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,879
What will happen when they combine?

27
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,639
Either it will successfully leave

28
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,439
or

29
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,959
it will accelerate the diffusion.

30
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,159
Chairman

31
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,959
What about the ladder base and the low-altitude station?

32
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,159
In case...

33
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,239
He once asked me.

34
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,319
Alert.

35
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,479
Energy remaining 9%.

36
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,959
Do you have confidence in me?

37
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,959
I didn't answer directly.

38
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,679
Alert.

39
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,879
Energy remaining 8%.

40
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,479
To be honest

41
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,479
I've had doubts too.

42
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,119
But now I have confidence.

43
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,479
Alert.

44
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,639
Energy remaining 7%.

45
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,239
because he is facing something

46
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,519
that we cannot imagine.

47
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,799
Alert.

48
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,879
Energy remaining 6%.

49
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,719
And he has come this far.

50
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,639
If a Wallfacer can die and come back to life

51
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,799
Alert.

52
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,879
Energy remaining 5%.

53
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,559
The Wallfacer plan can still be carried out.

54
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,319
Alert.

55
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,479
Energy remaining 3%.

56
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,159
The shielding layer of the quantum body starts to shift

57
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,759
Hurry up.

58
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,999
Bring that kid back.

59
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,559
Gravity is back.

60
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,639
That was fast.

61
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,879
I got it under control.

62
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,799
Are you okay?

63
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,319
Zhuang Yan.

64
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,559
Push against the door and hold onto the handrails tightly.

65
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,159
Search for a fixed position and look for nearby personnel.

66
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,519
The paralyzed system exerts a heavy force on the ring.

67
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,799
Alert. The E-ring and the F-ring has been closed off to personnel.

68
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,199
Don't block the way.

69
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,239
Start self-help and mutual aid now.

70
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,759
Go to the other side and wait for rescue.

71
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,759
Stay calm and stay safe.

72
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,359
Keep calm and keep people here. 

73
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,078
Run quickly and don't stop.

74
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,279
Prepare for oxygen deficiency and temperature loss.

75
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,639
Access to emergency supplies and reserves.

76
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,919
What's the matter?

77
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,559
Don't stop, let personnel in the F-ring and E-ring pass.

78
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,838
Ah, there are injured rescue personnel.

79
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,679
The danger is high, safety is paramount.

80
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,599
Pressure loss, temperature loss in the F-ring

81
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,119
Alert. Damaged structure Main Port II Ring 2 on High Alert.

82
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,439
I'm leaving now.

83
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,359
The seal.

84
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,599
Luo Ji.

85
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,319
Can you hear me?

86
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,039
Visual enhancements enabled.

87
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,959
Luo Ji.

88
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,639
Luo Ji, can you hear me?

89
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,039
Luo Ji.

90
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,999
Luo Ji.

91
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,159
Luo Ji.

92
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,439
I just had a dream.

93
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,719
Everything in the dream

94
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,639
was so real.

95
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,039
But I couldn't find you.

96
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,959
Don’t worry.

97
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,679
I'm here.

98
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,999
No matter what time or space.

99
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,759
No matter how many possibilities.

100
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,399
You will always come back to me.

101
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,359
Just like now.

102
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,279
You took such a great risk for me.

103
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,919
Maybe my happiness

104
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,519
really is part of your plan.

105
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,639
Isn't it?

106
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,119
I want to give you all my happiness and joy.

107
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,759
If time could stop

108
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,919
Just one more second

109
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,319
One second is enough.

110
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,719
The electromagnetic wave readings have appeared.

111
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,239
The shielding layer is migrating upwards.

112
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,919
The signal from the high-altitude station can be searched.

113
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,279
Where is the quantum body?

114
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,279
It's following the auxiliary nuclear power station

115
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,599
towards deep space.

116
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,039
Is the Wallfacer safe?

117
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,679
We are currently searching for spacesuit signals.

118
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,399
No need

119
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,399
I see them now.

120
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,959
This guy is really lucky

121
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,399
He actually passed through between two quantum bodies.

122
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,199
Only in your eyes

123
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,599
do I feel that there is another side to the universe.

124
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,639
I feel that space-time

125
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,759
is collapsing towards us. 

126
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,199
The stars are vibrating in the galaxy

127
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,759
and all of this

128
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,199
is engulfed in the light of love's creation.

129
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,959
The night sky is a black sphere

130
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,559
studded with countless silver stars.

131
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,399
Inside there

132
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,239
is the world we live in

133
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,159
with many mountains like the Greater Khingan

134
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,199
Stretching far and wide

135
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,479
in all directions.

136
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,719
Perhaps this is humanity's sunset.

137
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,919
But I remember in Qijiadian

138
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,159
When it got dark

139
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,199
sometimes people would light a lamp

140
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,199
then there was nothing to fear.

141
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,159
The darkness is also gentle.

142
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,199
The light from the charcoal fire

143
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,839
looks so beautiful.
